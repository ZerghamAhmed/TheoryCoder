```

**Explanation:**

To win the level, we need to reach the **flag object** located at position `[7, 7]`. However, there are obstacles (`goop_obj`) and rules that prevent us from reaching it directly. The current active rules are:

- **Baba is You**: We control Baba, located at `[2, 6]`.
- **Flag is Win**: Touching the flag wins the game.
- **Goop is Sink**: Goop objects will sink (destroy) any object that moves onto them.

The strategy involves breaking the "Goop is Sink" rule so we can safely cross the goop objects blocking our path to the flag.

**Step-by-step Actions:**

1. **Move Down x4**: Navigate Baba from `[2, 6]` to `[2, 2]` to reach the row aligned with the "Goop is Sink" rule words.
   - Positions: `[2, 5]`, `[2, 4]`, `[2, 3]`, `[2, 2]`.
2. **Move Right x4**: Move Baba to the "Goop" word at `[6, 2]`.
   - Positions: `[3, 2]`, `[4, 2]`, `[5, 2]`, `[6, 2]`.
3. **Push "Goop" Word Up**: At `[6, 2]`, push the "goop_word" upwards to `[6, 3]`, breaking the "Goop is Sink" rule.
   - **Action**: `up` (the "goop_word" moves to `[6, 3]`; Baba remains at `[6, 2]`).
4. **Move Up x5**: Navigate Baba through the goop objects, which are no longer sink, towards the flag.
   - Positions: `[6, 3]`, `[6, 4]` (goop), `[6, 5]` (goop), `[6, 6]`, `[6, 7]`.
5. **Move Right**: Move Baba to `[7, 7]`, where the flag is located.
   - Position: `[7, 7]`.

By breaking the "Goop is Sink" rule, the goop objects lose their sinking property, allowing Baba to pass through them without being destroyed. Reaching the flag at `[7, 7]` with the rule "Flag is Win" active wins the level.
