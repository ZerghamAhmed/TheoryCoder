```Python
["up", "up", "up", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:

The previous predicted action sequence of `['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'down']` did not win the game because it continuously moved the "baba_obj" downwards into positions that were either empty or obstructed by the game boundaries. This led to a situation where "baba_obj" effectively sank into the bottom of the grid and was unable to reach the `flag_obj`.

To win the level, the corrected action sequence moves "baba_obj" vertically upward three times to (2, 4), which is just above its starting position at (2, 1). The following two actions then move it to the right horizontally to (2, 5) and (2, 6), which would eventually allow it to push against the `flag_obj`. Overall, this movement plan allows "baba_obj" to navigate through the grid without encountering borders, leading to the successful completion of the level.
