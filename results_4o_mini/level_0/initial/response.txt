To win the level based on the provided information, we need to move Baba to the flag object according to the high-level plan: `['move_to baba_obj_1 flag_obj_1']`. Here are the steps to achieve that, given the initial state and the layout of the object positions on the grid.

The initial state indicates that Baba is located at (2, 4), and the flag is located at (7, 4). 

1. Move from (2, 4) to (3, 4) - **down** (Baba moves downwards)
2. Move from (3, 4) to (4, 4) - **down**
3. Move from (4, 4) to (5, 4) - **down**
4. Move from (5, 4) to (6, 4) - **down**
5. Move from (6, 4) to (7, 4) - **down** (This brings Baba to the same position as the flag object)

This action sequence effectively moves Baba directly down to the flag object, fulfilling the objective of moving to it.

Hereâ€™s the final action sequence:

```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "down"]
```
