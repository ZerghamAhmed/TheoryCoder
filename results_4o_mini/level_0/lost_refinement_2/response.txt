```Python
["up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right"]
```

The previous action sequence of `['up', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right']` failed to win the level because it only moved the `baba_obj` upward and then right, but stopped one square short of reaching the `flag_obj` (which is at coordinate (7, 4)). Thus, we did not move to the `flag_obj` as required in the high-level plan of `['move_to baba_obj_1 flag_obj_1']`.

In my proposed action sequence, I ensure to move `baba_obj` up three times to (2, 7) and then turn right three times, moving to (5, 7), (6, 7), and finally reaching (7, 7) adjacent to the `flag_obj`. This corrected sequence allows `baba_obj` to successfully reach the `flag_obj`, thus winning the level.
