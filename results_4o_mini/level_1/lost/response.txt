```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right", "up"]
``` 

**Explanation:**  
1. **Move "baba_obj" down** four times to reach the row where the "flag_obj" is located.
2. **Move right** two times to reach the column of the flag.
3. **Move up** two times to align with the "flag_word" (located just above the flag object).
4. **Move right** two times to position above the flag object, then the action would form the required rule with "flag_word" and can push towards the win condition (the implementation would handle checking for overlaps etc.). 

These moves ensure reaching the appropriate location to successfully execute the high-level plan.
