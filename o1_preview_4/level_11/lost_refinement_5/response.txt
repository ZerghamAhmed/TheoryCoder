```Python
["down", "down", "down", "left", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

**Why the previous action sequence did not win the game:**

In the previous action sequence:

```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "up", "up"]
```

we attempted to navigate Baba directly to the Flag at position `[7,7]` by moving through Goop tiles. However, since the "Goop is Sink" rule was active, stepping onto a Goop tile resulted in Baba being destroyed due to the Sink property. Specifically, when Baba moved onto the Goop tile at `[7,5]`, both Baba and the Goop were destroyed, leading to a loss because there were no controllable objects left.

The key issue was that we did not deactivate the "Goop is Sink" rule before attempting to cross the Goop tiles. Additionally, trying to navigate around the Goop was not feasible due to the level's layout and the placement of borders and other obstacles.

**How the corrected action sequence leads to winning the game:**

1. **Break the "Goop is Sink" Rule:**

   - **Move Down x3:** `["down", "down", "down"]`
     - Baba moves from `[2,6]` to `[2,3]`, navigating through empty spaces.
   - **Move Left:** `["left"]`
     - Baba moves from `[2,3]` to `[1,3]`, pushing the "Goop" word at `[1,3]` to the right into `[2,3]`.
     - This action misaligns the "Goop is Sink" rule, which was vertically formed by "Goop" at `[1,3]`, "Is" at `[1,2]`, and "Sink" at `[1,1]`.
     - **Result:** The "Goop is Sink" rule is broken, and Goop tiles no longer have the Sink property.

2. **Navigate to the Flag:**

   - **Move Up x3:** `["up", "up", "up"]`
     - Baba moves from `[1,3]` to `[1,6]`, traversing over Goop tiles safely since they no longer have the Sink property.
   - **Move Right x5:** `["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]`
     - Baba moves from `[1,6]` to `[6,6]`, moving across tiles that were previously hazardous due to Goop.
   - **Move Up:** `["up"]`
     - Baba moves from `[6,6]` to `[6,7]`, getting closer to the Flag.
   - **Move Right:** `["right"]`
     - Baba moves from `[6,7]` to `[7,7]`, where the Flag is located.
     - **Win Condition:** Since "Flag is Win" is active, touching the Flag results in winning the game.

**Key Points:**

- **Pushing Text Objects:** In this level, text objects like "Goop", "Is", and "Sink" can be pushed without the "Text is Push" rule active. This is standard in many levels of the game.
- **Breaking the Rule:** By pushing the "Goop" word out of alignment, we effectively deactivate the "Goop is Sink" rule. The words are no longer aligned vertically, so the rule doesn't apply.
- **Safe Passage:** With the Sink property removed from Goop tiles, Baba can safely traverse over them without being destroyed.
- **Direct Path to the Flag:** The corrected action sequence provides a clear and unobstructed route to the Flag, ensuring that Baba can win the game.

**Summary:**

By adjusting our strategy to break the "Goop is Sink" rule, we eliminate the hazard posed by the Goop tiles. This allows Baba to reach the Flag at `[7,7]` without being destroyed. The corrected action sequence ensures that Baba successfully navigates the level, leading to a win.
