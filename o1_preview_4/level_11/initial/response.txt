```

**Explanation:**

Starting from the initial position of Baba at `[2, 6]`, the goal is to reach the Flag at `[7, 7]` while navigating around obstacles and utilizing the game's mechanics.

1. **Move Down 4 times**: `"down", "down", "down", "down"`
   - Moves Baba from `[2, 6]` to `[2, 2]`.
   - This path is clear of obstacles and avoids the Goop tiles to the left and right.

2. **Move Right 6 times**: `"right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"`
   - Moves Baba from `[2, 2]` to `[8, 2]`.
   - Traverses through empty spaces below the Goop obstacles.

3. **Move Up**: `"up"`
   - Baba moves to `[8, 3]`, pushing the Rock at `[8, 3]`.
   - Since "ROCK IS PUSH" is active, Baba can push Rocks.

4. **Move Left 3 times**: `"left", "left", "left"`
   - Pushes the Rocks from `[8, 3]` to `[5, 3]`.
   - The Rock at `[5, 3]` sinks into the Goop at `[5, 3]` due to "GOOP IS SINK", removing both the Rock and Goop and clearing the path.

5. **Move Right**: `"right"`
   - Baba moves to `[6, 3]` to position behind the second Rock.

6. **Move Up 3 times**: `"up", "up", "up"`
   - Pushes the Rock from `[6, 3]` through `[6, 4]`, `[6, 5]`, and stops at `[6, 6]`.
   - The Rock sinks the Goop at `[6, 4]` and `[6, 5]`, clearing the vertical path.

7. **Move Right**: `"right"`
   - Moves Baba to `[7, 6]`, approaching the Flag from the side.

8. **Move Up**: `"up"`
   - Moves Baba to `[7, 7]`, the location of the Flag.
   - Since "FLAG IS WIN" is active, reaching the Flag wins the level.

By following this sequence of actions, Baba successfully navigates around the Goop obstacles by utilizing the Rocks to eliminate the "Sinking" Goop tiles and creates a clear path to the Flag, achieving victory in the level.
