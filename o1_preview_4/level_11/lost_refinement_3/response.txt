```Python
["down", "down", "down", "left", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

**Why the previous action sequence did not win the game:**

In the previous attempt, the action sequence was:

`["down", "down", "down", "down", "down", "left", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]`

The intent was to deactivate the "Goop is Sink" rule by pushing the "Is" word at position `[1,2]` out of alignment. However, this strategy failed because:

- **Blocked Movement:** Baba could not push the "Is" word at `[1,2]` left because there was a border at `[0,2]`, preventing any further movement in that direction.
- **Immovable Object:** Attempting to move left into the "Is" word did not push it to the right because the game mechanics only allow pushing objects in the direction of movement, and pushing left was blocked.
- **Unbroken Rule:** As a result, the "Goop is Sink" rule remained active. When Baba moved towards the Flag, stepping onto a Goop tile at `[3,3]`, Baba was destroyed due to the Sink property.
- **Game Lost:** With no controllable objects left, the game was lost.

**Corrected action sequence and how it leads to winning the game:**

1. **Break the "Goop is Sink" Rule:**
   - **Move Down x3:** `["down", "down", "down"]`
     - Baba moves from `[2,6]` to `[2,3]`.
   - **Move Left:** `["left"]`
     - Baba moves from `[2,3]` to `[1,3]`, pushing the "Goop" word at `[1,3]` to the right into `[2,3]`.
     - This action misaligns the "Goop is Sink" rule (previously formed vertically at `[1,3]`, `[1,2]`, `[1,1]`), effectively deactivating the Sink property of Goop tiles.

2. **Navigate to the Flag:**
   - **Move Up x3:** `["up", "up", "up"]`
     - Baba moves from `[1,3]` to `[1,6]`, traversing over Goop tiles safely since they no longer have the Sink property.
   - **Move Right x5:** `["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]`
     - Baba moves from `[1,6]` to `[6,6]`, moving across the path that was previously hazardous due to Goop tiles.
   - **Move Up:** `["up"]`
     - Baba moves from `[6,6]` to `[6,7]`, getting closer to the Flag.
   - **Move Right:** `["right"]`
     - Baba moves from `[6,7]` to `[7,7]`, where the Flag is located.
   - **Win Condition:** Since "Flag is Win" is active, touching the Flag at `[7,7]` results in winning the game.

**Summary of the Solution:**

By pushing the "Goop" word out of alignment, we successfully break the "Goop is Sink" rule. This allows Baba to safely traverse over Goop tiles without being destroyed. The corrected action sequence ensures that Baba can reach the Flag without any obstacles leading to a loss.

**Key Points:**

- **Avoid Impassable Borders:** We avoided attempting to push words into borders, which was a limitation in the previous attempt.
- **Utilize Game Mechanics:** We took advantage of the ability to push words in feasible directions to alter game rules.
- **Ensure Rule Deactivation:** Breaking the specific alignment of the words "Goop is Sink" was crucial to deactivate the Sink property.
- **Safe Navigation:** With the Sink property deactivated, the path to the Flag is clear, allowing Baba to win the game.

By carefully adjusting our strategy and understanding the game's mechanics, we corrected the action sequence to achieve the desired outcome.
