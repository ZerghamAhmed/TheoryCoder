explanation:

The previous action sequence did not win the game because Baba moved onto a Goop tile while the "Goop is Sink" rule was still active. When Baba stepped onto the Goop at position [6,4], both Baba and the Goop were destroyed due to the Sink property, resulting in the game being lost because there were no controllable objects left.

To correct this, we need to first deactivate the "Goop is Sink" rule so that Baba can safely traverse over Goop tiles. We achieve this by breaking the rule formation. Starting from the initial position, Baba moves down four times to reach [2,2], then left to [1,2], where the "is" word of the "Goop is Sink" rule is located. Moving up to [1,3], Baba pushes the "Goop" word out of alignment, thus breaking the "Goop is Sink" rule.

With the rule broken, Goop tiles no longer have the Sink property, and Baba can safely move over them. Baba then moves right six times to navigate towards the Flag at [7,7]. Finally, Baba moves up four times to reach the Flag. Since "Flag is Win" is active, touching the Flag results in winning the game.
