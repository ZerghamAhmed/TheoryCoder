```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "left", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

Starting at position (2,4), we need to manipulate the words in the game to create the rule "FLAG IS WIN" and then touch the flag object to win the level. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Move Right x4**: We move right four times to reach position (6,4), directly below the 'FLAG_WORD' at (6,5).
   - Actions: `["right", "right", "right", "right"]`

2. **Push 'FLAG_WORD' Up x3**: We push the 'FLAG_WORD' upwards from (6,5) to (6,8). This aligns it horizontally with the other words we need.
   - Actions: `["up", "up", "up"]`

3. **Move Left x1**: We move left to position (5,8), pushing the 'FLAG_WORD' left to (5,8). This sets up the horizontal sequence for "FLAG IS WIN".
   - Actions: `["left"]`

4. **Push 'IS_WORD' Left x1**: Moving right back to (6,8), we push the 'IS_WORD' left from (7,8) to (6,8).
   - Actions: `["right"]`

5. **Push 'WIN_WORD' Left x1**: Continuing right to (7,8), we push the 'WIN_WORD' left from (8,8) to (7,8). Now, we've formed "FLAG IS WIN" at positions (5,8), (6,8), (7,8).
   - Actions: `["right"]`

6. **Move Down x4**: We move down four times from (7,8) to (7,4), where the 'FLAG_OBJ' is located.
   - Actions: `["down", "down", "down", "down"]`

7. **Touch the Flag**: Finally, we move right to touch the 'FLAG_OBJ' at (7,4), which is now a win condition due to the rule we created.
   - Actions: `["right"]`

By forming the rule "FLAG IS WIN" and then touching the flag, we satisfy the win condition of the level.
