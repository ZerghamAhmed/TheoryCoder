```Python
["left", "up", "up", "left", "left", "down", "down", "left"]
```

**Explanation:**

**Why the Previous Action Sequence Did Not Win:**

The previous action sequence `['left', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'down']` did not win the game because the final **"down"** action pushed the **'WIN'** word out of alignment, disrupting the formation of the **'BABA IS WIN'** rule. Additionally, during the sequence, movements interfered with the **'IS'** word at **[5,7]**, which is part of the **'BABA IS YOU'** rule. Pushing this **'IS'** word caused the **'BABA IS YOU'** rule to break, resulting in the loss of control over **'baba_obj'** and leading to a game loss.

**Corrected Action Sequence and How It Leads to Winning:**

The corrected action sequence ensures that we avoid breaking the **'BABA IS YOU'** rule while successfully forming the **'BABA IS WIN'** rule. Here's how the sequence works:

1. **"left"**: Move **'baba_obj'** from **[5,4]** to **[4,4]**.
2. **"up", "up"**: Move up to **[4,6]** without disturbing any important words.
   - **[4,5]**: Move up to **[4,5]**.
   - **[4,6]**: Move up to **[4,6]**.
3. **"left", "left"**: Push the **'BABA'** word left to align it over **'IS'** and **'WIN'**.
   - **[3,6]**: Push **'BABA'** to **[3,7]**.
   - **[2,6]**: Push **'BABA'** to **[2,7]**.
4. **"down", "down"**: Push the **'BABA'** word down to form a vertical **'BABA IS WIN'** rule.
   - **[2,5]**: Push **'BABA'** down, which pushes **'IS'** and **'WIN'** down as well.
   - **[2,4]**: Push **'BABA'** down again, aligning all words vertically as:
     - **[2,4]**: 'BABA'
     - **[2,3]**: 'IS'
     - **[2,2]**: 'WIN'
5. **"left"**: Move **'baba_obj'** to **[1,4]** (optional, ensures positioning is correct).

By executing these actions, we create the vertical rule **'BABA IS WIN'** while maintaining the existing **'BABA IS YOU'** rule. Since **'baba_obj'** still has the **'YOU'** property and now also has the **'WIN'** property, the game recognizes a win condition, and you win the level.

**Summary:**

- We carefully avoided pushing the **'IS'** word at **[5,7]**, thus maintaining the **'BABA IS YOU'** rule.
- We formed the new rule **'BABA IS WIN'** by aligning the words vertically.
- We ensured that **'baba_obj'** remained controllable until the win condition was achieved.
- By aligning the words without breaking any critical rules, we successfully complete the level.
