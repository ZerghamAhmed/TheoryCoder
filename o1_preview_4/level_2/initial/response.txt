```Python
["left", "left", "left", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

To win the level, we need to create the rule **"BABA IS WIN"** while maintaining **"BABA IS YOU"** so that we continue to control Baba and satisfy the win condition simultaneously.

1. **Move Left Three Times**:
   - Starting from position `[5, 4]` (Baba's initial location), we move **left** three times to reach the `WIN` word at `[2, 4]`.
   - Actions: `"left", "left", "left"`

2. **Push WIN Word to the Right**:
   - Standing at `[2, 4]`, we push the `WIN` word to the right by moving **right** three times, bringing it to position `[5, 4]`.
   - Actions: `"right", "right", "right"`
   - The `WIN` word is now directly below the `IS` word at `[5, 7]`.

3. **Move Up Three Times to Form "BABA IS WIN"**:
   - From `[5, 4]`, we move **up** three times, pushing the `WIN` word upwards.
   - Actions: `"up", "up", "up"`
   - This moves the `WIN` word to `[5, 7]`, aligning it with the `BABA` word at `[4, 7]` and the `IS` word at `[5, 7]`.
   - The sentence **"BABA IS WIN"** is now formed horizontally at row `7`.

4. **Maintaining "BABA IS YOU"**:
   - The existing rule **"BABA IS YOU"** remains intact since we haven't disturbed the `YOU` word at `[6, 7]` or the `IS` word necessary for the rule.
   - Both rules **"BABA IS YOU"** and **"BABA IS WIN"** are active.

**Outcome:**

With both rules active, Baba is both the character we control and also the win condition. Since we are controlling Baba and Baba is defined as win, we satisfy the game's win condition and thus win the level.
