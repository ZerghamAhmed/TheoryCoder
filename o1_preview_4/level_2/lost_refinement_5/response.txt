```Python
['left', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'down']
```

**Explanation:**

**Why the Previous Action Sequence Did Not Win:**

The previous action sequence `['left', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'down']` did not win the game because the final `"down"` action pushed the **`WIN`** word too far down. Specifically, it moved the **`WIN`** word from position **[2,3]** to **[2,2]**, resulting in a misalignment. As a consequence, the **`BABA IS WIN`** rule was not correctly formed, and the game did not recognize the win condition. Additionally, pushing **`WIN`** off its intended position made it impossible to form the vertical alignment necessary for the rule to be effective.

**Corrected Action Sequence and How It Leads to Winning:**

The corrected action sequence removes the unnecessary extra `"down"` action at the end, preventing the **`WIN`** word from being pushed too far down. Here's how the corrected action sequence works step by step:

1. **`"left"`**: Move **`baba_obj`** from **[5,4]** to **[4,4]**.
   
2. **`"up"`, `"up"`**: Move up to reach **[4,6]**.
   - **[4,5]**: First `"up"` moves **`baba_obj`** to **[4,5]**.
   - **[4,6]**: Second `"up"` moves **`baba_obj`** to **[4,6]**.

3. **`"left"`, `"left"`**: Push the **`BABA`** word left to align it over **`IS`** and **`WIN`**.
   - **[3,6]**: First `"left"` pushes the **`BABA`** word from **[4,7]** to **[3,7]** and moves **`baba_obj`** to **[3,6]**.
   - **[2,6]**: Second `"left"` pushes the **`BABA`** word from **[3,7]** to **[2,7]** and moves **`baba_obj`** to **[2,6]**.

4. **`"down"`**: Push the **`BABA`** word down to form the vertical **`BABA IS WIN`** rule.
   - **[2,5]**: The `"down"` action pushes the **`BABA`** word to **[2,6]**, **`IS`** word to **[2,5]**, and **`WIN`** word to **[2,4]**. **`baba_obj`** moves to **[2,5]**.

After these actions, the words are aligned vertically as:

- **[2,6]**: **`BABA`**
- **[2,5]**: **`IS`**
- **[2,4]**: **`WIN`**

This forms the rule **`BABA IS WIN`** correctly. Since the **`BABA IS YOU`** rule remains intact (the words at **[4,7]**, **[5,7]**, and **[6,7]** were not disturbed), and **`baba_obj`** still has the **`YOU`** property, the game recognizes that **`BABA`** is both **`YOU`** and **`WIN`**, satisfying the win condition.

**Summary:**

- **Avoided pushing the `WIN` word too far down**: By removing the extra `"down"` action, we kept **`WIN`** at the correct position.
- **Maintained the `BABA IS YOU` rule**: We did not interfere with the words forming this rule, so **`baba_obj`** remained controllable.
- **Formed the `BABA IS WIN` rule correctly**: The vertical alignment of **`BABA`**, **`IS`**, and **`WIN`** at positions **[2,6]**, **[2,5]**, and **[2,4]** establishes the new rule.
- **Won the game**: With both rules in place, the game recognizes the win condition, and you win the level.

By following this corrected action sequence, you successfully complete the level without breaking any critical rules.
