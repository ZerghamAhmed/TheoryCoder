```Python
["down", "down", "right", "up", "right", "up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not lead to a victory because it was missing a crucial final move for Baba to reach the flag, which is necessary to win the game due to the "FLAG IS WIN" rule. Specifically, after Baba broke the "WALL IS STOP" rule by pushing the `STOP` and `IS` words out of alignment, he needed one additional **"up"** move to step onto the flag at position `(6, 7)`.

In the corrected action sequence, an extra **"up"** action has been added at the end, allowing Baba to move onto the flag and win the level. Here is how the corrected action sequence leads to victory:

1. **down**, **down**: Move Baba from `(6, 4)` to `(6, 2)`.
2. **right**, **up**: Move Baba to `(7, 3)`.
3. **right**: Push the `STOP` word left from `(8, 3)` to `(7, 3)`, breaking the vertical "WALL IS STOP" rule.
4. **up**: Push the `IS` word left from `(8, 4)` to `(7, 4)`, further disrupting the rule.
5. **up**, **up**: Move Baba upwards through the wall (since "WALL IS STOP" is broken) to `(8, 6)`.
6. **left**, **left**: Move Baba to `(6, 6)`, approaching the flag.
7. **up**, **up**: Move Baba onto the flag at `(6, 7)`, triggering a win due to "FLAG IS WIN".

By adding the final **"up"** action, Baba successfully reaches the flag and wins the level. The omission of this crucial move in the previous sequence is why the game was not won earlier.
