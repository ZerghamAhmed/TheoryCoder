```Python
["down", "down", "right", "up", "right", "up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "up", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not result in a win because it was missing a crucial **final "up" move** for Baba to reach the flag at position `(6, 7)`. After breaking the "WALL IS STOP" rule by moving the `stop_word` and `is_word` out of alignment, Baba moved through the wall but stopped just before reaching the flag due to the missing move.

In the corrected action sequence, we add an extra **"up"** at the end, allowing Baba to step onto the flag, which is necessary to win the game because of the "FLAG IS WIN" rule. This adjustment ensures that Baba reaches the flag and the level is successfully completed.
