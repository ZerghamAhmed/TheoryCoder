```Python
["down", "down", "right", "up", "up", "right", "down", "right", "up", "up", "up", "left", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it failed to break the "WALL IS STOP" rule effectively. Specifically, when Baba attempted to push the `stop_word` by moving **right** from position `(7,3)`, the action had no effect because the `stop_word` could not be pushed left due to the `is_word` blocking it from above. This meant that "WALL IS STOP" remained in effect, preventing Baba from passing through the wall to reach the flag.

In the corrected action sequence, we adjust the steps to successfully disrupt the "WALL IS STOP" rule:

1. **down**, **down**: Move Baba from `(6,4)` to `(6,2)`.
2. **right**, **up**, **up**: Move Baba to `(7,4)`.
3. **right**: Push the `is_word` from `(8,4)` to `(7,4)`, breaking its alignment in the vertical "WALL IS STOP" sentence.
4. **down**: Move Baba back to `(7,3)`.
5. **right**: Push the `stop_word` from `(8,3)` to `(7,3)`, further disrupting the sentence.
6. Now that "WALL IS STOP" is broken, Baba can pass through walls.
7. **up**, **up**, **up**: Move Baba upwards through the wall to `(7,6)`.
8. **left**: Move Baba to `(6,6)`, positioning Baba directly below the flag.
9. **up**: Move Baba onto the flag at `(6,7)`, triggering a win due to the "FLAG IS WIN" rule.

By first pushing the `is_word` to the left, we create space to push the `stop_word` and effectively break the "WALL IS STOP" rule. This allows Baba to pass through the wall and reach the flag, resulting in a victory. The omission of these critical steps in the previous action sequence is why the game was not won earlier.
