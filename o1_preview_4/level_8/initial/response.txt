```Python
["left", "left", "left", "down", "left", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:

We start with Baba (our controllable character) at position `[5, 4]`. Our goal is to reach the Flag at position `[5, 8]`, but there's a horizontal wall at `y = 6` blocking the path, and currently, "Wall Is Stop" is active, preventing us from passing through the walls.

1. **Break "Wall Is Stop":**
   - **Move Left thrice** (`"left", "left", "left"`): This brings Baba from `[5, 4]` to `[2, 4]`, right next to the "Stop" word at `[2, 3]`.
   - **Move Down once** (`"down"`): Baba moves to `[2, 3]`, where the "Stop" word is.
   - **Push "Stop" word Left** (`"left"`): By moving left, Baba pushes the "Stop" word from `[2, 3]` to `[1, 3]`. This breaks the vertical arrangement of "Wall Is Stop" (`[2, 5]` "Wall", `[2, 4]` "Is", and now "Stop" is at `[1, 3]`), effectively deactivating the rule.

2. **Navigate to the Flag:**
   - **Move Right thrice** (`"right", "right", "right"`): Baba moves back to `[5, 3]`, aligning with the column of the Flag.
   - **Move Up five times** (`"up", "up", "up", "up", "up"`): Baba moves from `y = 3` to `y = 8`, passing through the walls at `y = 6` (since walls no longer stop Baba) and reaching the Flag at `[5, 8]`.

Since the rule "Flag Is Win" is already formed (with "Flag" at `[6, 1]`, "Is" at `[7, 1]`, and "Win" at `[8, 1]`), touching the Flag causes us to win the level.
