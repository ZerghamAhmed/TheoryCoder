```Python

["left", "left", "left", "up", "up", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right"]

```

**Explanation:**

In the previous action sequence, after moving **left** three times to push the `is_word` out of the `wall is stop` rule, you moved **right** three times to return to your original position. This was unnecessary and wasted valuable moves. By returning to the starting position, you did not make progress toward reaching the flag.

**Corrected Action Sequence:**

1. **left**: Move Baba from `[5, 4]` to `[4, 4]`.
2. **left**: Move Baba from `[4, 4]` to `[3, 4]`.
3. **left**: Move Baba from `[3, 4]` to `[2, 4]`, pushing the `is_word` from `[2, 4]` to `[1, 4]` and breaking the `wall is stop` rule.
4. **up**: Move Baba to `[2, 5]`.
5. **up**: Move Baba to `[2, 6]`. Since the `wall is stop` rule is broken, Baba can pass through the wall.
6. **right**: Move Baba to `[3, 6]`.
7. **up**: Move Baba to `[3, 7]`.
8. **up**: Move Baba to `[3, 8]`.
9. **right**: Move Baba to `[4, 8]`.
10. **right**: Move Baba to `[5, 8]`, where the `flag_obj` is located.

By proceeding directly toward the flag after breaking the `wall is stop` rule, you avoid unnecessary movements and efficiently reach the flag to win the level.
