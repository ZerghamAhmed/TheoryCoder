```Python
['down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'up']
```

**Explanation:**

**Why the Previous Action Sequence Did Not Win the Game:**

The previous action sequence attempted to create the rule "rock is win" by pushing the `rock_word` upwards to align it with the `is_word` at [2,8] and the `win_word` at [8,8]. However, this approach failed because the words did not form a valid rule due to misalignment. Specifically, the `rock_word` was not correctly aligned with both `is_word` and `win_word` horizontally or vertically, preventing the formation of the intended game rule. As a result, touching the `rock_obj` did not trigger the win condition.

**Corrected Action Sequence and How It Leads to Winning:**

1. **Move Down 2 times**: `['down', 'down']`
   - Moves Baba from [2,5] to [2,3], positioning Baba next to the `rock_word` at [4,3].

2. **Move Right 3 times**: `['right', 'right', 'right']`
   - Baba pushes the `rock_word` from [4,3] to [6,3], moving it towards the bottom row.

3. **Move Down 2 times**: `['down', 'down']`
   - Baba pushes the `rock_word` from [6,3] down to [6,1], aligning it horizontally with `is_word` at [7,1] and `win_word` at [8,1].
   - This forms the rule **"rock is win"** horizontally at the bottom of the map.

4. **Move Right**: `['right']`
   - Moves Baba to [7,1], setting up to reach the `rock_obj`.

5. **Move Up 4 times**: `['up', 'up', 'up', 'up']`
   - Moves Baba from [7,1] to [7,5], where the `rock_obj` is located.

By forming the rule "rock is win" at the bottom row and then moving Baba to touch the `rock_obj` at [7,5], we meet the win condition and successfully complete the level. This action sequence effectively modifies the game rules and leads directly to victory.
