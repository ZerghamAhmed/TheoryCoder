```Python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "down", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "down", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

**Why the Previous Action Sequence Did Not Win the Game:**

The previous action sequence attempted to create the rule "rock is win" by pushing the `rock_word` upwards along column 4 to align with the `is_word` at [2,8] and form the rule horizontally. However, the `is_word` and `win_word` needed to complete the rule were located at [7,8] and [8,8], respectively. By pushing the `rock_word` to [4,8], it did not align horizontally with `is_word` and `win_word`, thus failing to form "rock is win". As a result, touching the `rock_obj` did not result in winning the game because the win condition was not established.

**Corrected Action Sequence and How It Leads to Winning:**

1. **Move Down 2 times**: `["down", "down"]`
   - Moves Baba from [2,5] to [2,3], positioning Baba near the `rock_word` at [4,3].

2. **Move Right 3 times**: `["right", "right", "right"]`
   - Baba pushes the `rock_word` from [4,3] to [6,3], moving it closer to align with the `is_word` and `win_word`.

3. **Move Down and Right**: `["down", "right"]`
   - Baba moves to position behind the `rock_word` at [6,2], preparing to push it upwards.

4. **Push `rock_word` Up 5 times**: `["up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]`
   - Baba pushes the `rock_word` up from [6,3] to [6,8], aligning it horizontally with `is_word` at [7,8] and `win_word` at [8,8].
   - This forms the rule **"rock is win"**.

5. **Move Right and Down 2 times**: `["right", "down", "down"]`
   - Baba moves to the `rock_obj` at [7,5].

By forming the rule "rock is win" and then touching the `rock_obj`, Baba meets the win condition, resulting in winning the level. This corrected action sequence successfully manipulates the game rules and leads to victory.
