```Python
["left", "left", "left", "left", "left"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the initial state, the following rules are active:

1. **FLAG IS YOU:** This means we control the `flag_obj` located at position `[7, 6]`.
2. **LOVE IS YOU:** This means we also control the `love_obj` located at position `[7, 3]`.
3. **BABA IS WIN:** The `baba_obj` at position `[2, 6]` is a WIN object.
4. **GRASS IS WIN:** The `grass_obj` at position `[2, 3]` is also a WIN object.

Our goal is to move one of our controllable objects (`flag_obj` or `love_obj`) onto a WIN object (`baba_obj` or `grass_obj`) to win the level.

To achieve this, we can move both `flag_obj` and `love_obj` to the left simultaneously. Since both objects are aligned horizontally with their respective WIN objects (they share the same `y` coordinates), moving left will bring them closer to the WIN objects without any obstacles in the way.

Here's the step-by-step movement:

- **Initial Positions:**
  - `flag_obj`: `[7, 6]`
  - `love_obj`: `[7, 3]`

- **Move Left 1:**
  - `flag_obj`: `[6, 6]`
  - `love_obj`: `[6, 3]`

- **Move Left 2:**
  - `flag_obj`: `[5, 6]`
  - `love_obj`: `[5, 3]`

- **Move Left 3:**
  - `flag_obj`: `[4, 6]`
  - `love_obj`: `[4, 3]`

- **Move Left 4:**
  - `flag_obj`: `[3, 6]`
  - `love_obj`: `[3, 3]`

- **Move Left 5:**
  - `flag_obj`: `[2, 6]` — now overlaps with `baba_obj`
  - `love_obj`: `[2, 3]` — now overlaps with `grass_obj`

Upon reaching these positions, both controllable objects are on top of WIN objects. According to the game rules, when a controllable object (`YOU`) overlaps with a WIN object, you win the level.

**Why this works:**

- There are no obstacles (like borders or other objects) between the starting positions and the WIN objects.
- The simultaneous movement ensures both objects reach their respective WIN objects at the same time.
- Moving left is the most direct path to the WIN objects from the starting positions.

By following the action sequence `["left", "left", "left", "left", "left"]`, we successfully guide our controllable objects onto the WIN objects, thereby winning the level.
