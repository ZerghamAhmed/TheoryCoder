```Python

["up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "left", "left", "left", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]

```

Explanation:

First, we need to form the rule `baba_word is_word win_word` to win the level. Here's how the action sequence achieves this:

1. **Actions ["up", "up", "up"]**: Move `baba_obj` from its starting position `[5, 4]` to `[5, 7]`, pushing the `you_word` from `[6, 7]` to `[6, 7]` (overlaps) and then to `[7, 7]` and `[8, 7]`. This clears the path at `[6, 7]` for the `win_word`.

2. **Actions ["right", "right"]**: Continue pushing the `you_word` to the right, moving it to `[8, 7]` and beyond, ensuring it doesn't interfere with forming the new rule.

3. **Actions ["down", "down", "down"]**: Move `baba_obj` back down to its original vertical position at `[5, 4]`.

4. **Actions ["left", "left", "left"]**: Move `baba_obj` left to `[2, 4]`, overlapping with the `win_word` at `[2, 4]`.

5. **Actions ["right", "right", "right", "right"]**: Push the `win_word` to the right, moving it from `[2, 4]` to `[6, 4]`.

6. **Actions ["up", "up", "up"]**: Push the `win_word` upwards from `[6, 4]` to `[6, 7]`, aligning it with `baba_word` at `[4, 7]` and `is_word` at `[5, 7]`.

By executing these actions, we rearrange the words to form the horizontal rule `baba_word is_word win_word` at positions `[4,7]`, `[5,7]`, and `[6,7]`. This changes the game rule so that `baba` is `win`, and since we're controlling `baba_obj`, we immediately satisfy the win condition and win the level.
