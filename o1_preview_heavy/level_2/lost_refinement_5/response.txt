```Python

["up", "up", "left", "up", "left", "left", "down"]

```

Explanation:

This action sequence strategically moves the 'baba_word' into position to form the rule "baba is win" vertically. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **First Action - "up":**
   - *Move 'baba_obj' from [5, 4] to [5, 5].*
   
2. **Second Action - "up":**
   - *Move 'baba_obj' from [5, 5] to [5, 6].*
   
3. **Third Action - "left":**
   - *Move 'baba_obj' from [5, 6] to [4, 6].*
   
4. **Fourth Action - "up":**
   - *Move 'baba_obj' from [4, 6] to [4, 7].*

5. **Fifth Action - "left":**
   - *Push 'baba_word' from [4, 7] to [3, 7], moving 'baba_obj' to [3, 7].*

6. **Sixth Action - "left":**
   - *Push 'baba_word' from [3, 7] to [2, 7], moving 'baba_obj' to [2, 7].*

7. **Seventh Action - "down":**
   - *Push 'baba_word' from [2, 7] to [2, 6], moving 'baba_obj' to [2, 6].*

After these actions, the 'baba_word' is aligned vertically with 'is_word' at [2, 5] and 'win_word' at [2, 4], forming the rule **"baba is win"**. Since 'baba_obj' is still present and 'baba' is now defined as 'win', the game recognizes this state as a win condition, and thus you win the level.

This sequence is effective because it:

- **Utilizes the controllable 'baba_obj' to manipulate the game words.**
- **Ensures minimal movement without unnecessary steps that could lead to losing the game.**
- **Directly addresses the high-level plan by forming the required rule.**

By forming the rule "baba is win", we satisfy the win condition while keeping 'baba_obj' active on the board.
