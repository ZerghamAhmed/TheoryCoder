```Python
["down", "left", "left", "left", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "down", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

To achieve the high-level plan of forming the rule `baba_word is_word win_word` (which corresponds to "BABA IS WIN"), we need to align the words `baba_word`, `is_word`, and `win_word` either horizontally or vertically without any gaps.

Here's how the corrected action sequence accomplishes this:

1. **"down"**: Moves `baba_obj` from `[5, 4]` to `[5, 3]`, positioning it to approach `win_word` from below.

2. **"left", "left", "left"**: Moves `baba_obj` to `[2, 3]`, right below `win_word` at `[2, 4]`.

3. **"up", "up", "up"**: Pushes `win_word` up from `[2, 4]` to `[2, 7]`, while also pushing the `is_word` from `[2, 5]` up to `[2, 8]`.

4. **"right", "right", "right"**: Moves `baba_obj` to `[5, 7]`, pushing `win_word`, `baba_word`, and `is_word` to the right. This aligns the words horizontally as:
   - `baba_word` at `[5, 7]`
   - `is_word` at `[6, 7]`
   - `win_word` at `[7, 7]`

5. **"down", "down"**: Moves `baba_obj` down to `[5, 5]`, allowing the game to recognize the newly formed rule.

**Why this works:**

By aligning `baba_word`, `is_word`, and `win_word` horizontally at the same `y` coordinate without gaps, we form the rule "BABA IS WIN". In the game logic, forming this rule changes the win condition so that `baba_obj` becomes the winning object. Since we control `baba_obj` and it still exists on the board, the game recognizes that we've met the win condition, and thus we win the level.

This action sequence corrects the previous attempts by properly moving the word tiles into the correct positions to form the necessary rule, ensuring that the high-level plan is successfully executed and the level is won.
