```Python
["left", "left", "left", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right"]
```

### Explanation:

1. **Left x3**: The player starts at position `[5,4]`. Moving left three times brings them to `[2,4]`, where the `win_word` is located. As `win_word` is pushable, moving into it from the right will push it left if the space is free. However, since we're moving left, we'll instead push `win_word` upwards when we attempt to occupy its space.

2. **Up x3**: From `[2,4]`, moving up three times pushes the `win_word` upwards from `[2,4]` to `[2,7]`. During this process, if there's an `is_word` at `[2,5]`, it will be pushed up as well, stacking the words upwards.

3. **Right x2**: After pushing `win_word` up, the player is at `[2,7]`. Moving right twice brings the player to `[4,7]`. If `baba_word` is at `[4,7]`, pushing right will move `baba_word` to `[5,7]` and make space at `[4,7]`.

   - **First Right**: Moves `win_word` from `[2,7]` to `[3,7]`.
   - **Second Right**: Moves `win_word` from `[3,7]` to `[4,7]`, potentially pushing `baba_word` to the right if present.

4. **Forming the Rule**: By aligning `baba_word`, `is_word`, and `win_word` horizontally at row `y=7`, we form the new rule `baba_word is_word win_word`.

5. **Winning the Game**: With the new rule formed, `baba_obj` becomes the winning object. As the player is controlling `baba_obj`, they immediately win the game upon forming this rule.

This action sequence efficiently moves the necessary words into position to form the high-level plan `['form_rule baba_word is_word win_word']`, leading to a win in the level.
