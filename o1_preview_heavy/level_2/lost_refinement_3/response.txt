```Python
["down", "left", "left", "left", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

In our previous attempts, we tried to push the 'win_word' up to a certain point but didn't align it correctly with the 'baba_word' and 'is_word' to form the rule 'BABA IS WIN'. To correct this, we need to push the 'win_word' further up and then to the right to align it horizontally with 'baba_word' and 'is_word'. Here's how the corrected action sequence works:

1. **"down"**: Move 'baba_obj' from `[5, 4]` to `[5, 3]`.
2. **"left" x3**: Move left thrice to reach `[2, 3]`, pushing 'win_word' from `[2, 4]` up to `[2, 5]`.
3. **"up" x4**: Move up four times, pushing 'win_word' up to `[2, 8]`.
4. **"right" x3**: Move right three times to reach `[5, 7]`, pushing 'win_word' right to `[5, 7]`.

At this point, the positions are:
- **'baba_word'** at `[4, 7]`
- **'is_word'** at `[5, 7]`
- **'win_word'** at `[5, 7]` (overlapping with 'is_word')

However, overlapping words can't form rules, so we need to adjust slightly. Since overlapping isn't allowed, we actually need to ensure that 'win_word' is placed to the right of 'is_word'. So we need one more "right" move:

5. **"right"**: Move right to `[6, 7]`, pushing 'win_word' to `[6, 7]`.

Now, the words are aligned horizontally:
- **'baba_word'** at `[4, 7]`
- **'is_word'** at `[5, 7]`
- **'win_word'** at `[6, 7]`

This forms the rule **'BABA IS WIN'**.

With this rule formed and 'BABA IS YOU' still in effect, you (as 'baba_obj') are now also 'WIN'. This means you win the game upon the rule's formation.

**Why This Works:**

Forming the rule 'BABA IS WIN' by aligning 'baba_word', 'is_word', and 'win_word' horizontally allows the game to recognize that 'BABA' is now associated with the win condition. Since 'BABA IS YOU' is still an active rule (we didn't disrupt this rule during our movements), and you're controlling 'baba_obj', you simultaneously meet the win condition upon the rule's formation.

By pushing 'win_word' up to align with 'baba_word' and 'is_word', and then pushing it right to position it correctly, we effectively complete our high-level plan of forming the rule **'form_rule baba_word is_word win_word'**. This action sequence accomplishes that goal and results in winning the level.
