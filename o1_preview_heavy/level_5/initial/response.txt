```Python

["right", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up"]

```

Explanation:

1. **"right"**: Move Baba from position (2,5) to (3,5).
   
2. **"down"**: Move down to position (3,4).

3. **"down"**: Move down again to position (3,3) and push the "is_word" down to (3,2), breaking the rule **"rock_word is_word rock_word"**.

4. **"right"**: Move right to (4,3).

5. **"right"**: Move right to (5,3).

6. **"right"**: Move right to (6,3).

7. **"right"**: Move right to (7,3).

8. **"up"**: Move up to position (7,4), reaching the transformed **"flag_obj"** at (7,5).

By breaking the rule **"rock_word is_word rock_word"**, the conflicting rule is removed, allowing the rule **"rock_word is_word flag_word"** to take effect. This transformation turns the **"rock_obj"** at position (7,5) into a **"flag_obj"**. Moving Baba to this position causes the game to register a win due to the rule **"flag_word is_word win_word"** being active.
