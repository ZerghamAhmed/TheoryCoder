```Python
["right", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the previous action sequence, we successfully broke the rule `'rock_word is_word rock_word'` by moving down twice and right multiple times, which transformed the `'rock_obj'` into `'flag_obj'`. The `'flag_obj'` appeared at position `[7, 5]`. However, the sequence ended with `'baba_obj'` at position `[7, 4]`, which is one tile below the `'flag_obj'`.

To win the level, `'baba_obj'` must overlap with `'flag_obj'` because the rule `'flag_word is_word win_word'` is active, meaning that touching the flag results in a win. By adding an extra `'up'` action at the end of the sequence, `'baba_obj'` moves from `[7, 4]` to `[7, 5]`, overlapping with `'flag_obj'`. This triggers the win condition in the game logic, and the `'won'` state becomes `True`.

Therefore, the corrected action sequence ensures that we:

1. **Break the rule** `'rock_word is_word rock_word'` to transform the rock into a flag.
2. **Move `'baba_obj'` onto `'flag_obj'`** to trigger the win condition.

This sequence aligns with the high-level plan and results in winning the level.
