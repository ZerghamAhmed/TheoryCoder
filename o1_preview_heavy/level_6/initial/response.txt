```Python

["right", "up", "right", "up", "up", "right"]

```

**Explanation:**

Our goal is to execute the high-level plan which involves:

1. **Push rock_obj_4 to [5,3]**
2. **Push rock_obj_6 to [6,3]**
3. **Move Baba to the flag (flag_obj_1)**

Given the initial positions:

- **Baba (baba_obj_1)** is at **[2,2]**
- **rock_obj_4** is at **[4,3]** (since indexing starts from 1)
- **rock_obj_6** is at **[5,3]**
- **Flag (flag_obj_1)** is at **[5,5]**

**Step-by-step actions:**

1. **"right"**: Baba moves from **[2,2]** to **[3,2]**.
2. **"up"**: Baba moves from **[3,2]** to **[3,3]**.
3. **"right"**: Baba pushes rock_obj_4 from **[4,3]** to **[5,3]**. Since rock_obj_6 is at **[5,3]**, it gets pushed to **[6,3]** due to the game's recursive push mechanics.
4. **"up"**: Baba moves from **[4,3]** to **[4,4]**.
5. **"up"**: Baba moves from **[4,4]** to **[4,5]**.
6. **"right"**: Baba moves from **[4,5]** to **[5,5]**, overlapping with the flag.

**Why this works:**

- **Pushing Rocks**: By pushing rock_obj_4 to **[5,3]**, and consequently rock_obj_6 to **[6,3]**, we clear the path and fulfill the first two steps of the high-level plan.
- **Reaching the Flag**: Moving Baba to **[5,5]** (where the flag is located) triggers the win condition because the rule **"flag is win"** is active.
- **Game Mechanics**: The recursive push allows multiple rocks to be pushed simultaneously, and overlapping with the flag when **"flag is win"** results in winning the level.
  
This sequence of actions successfully accomplishes the high-level plan and results in winning the game.
