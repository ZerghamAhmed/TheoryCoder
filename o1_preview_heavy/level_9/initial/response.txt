```Python
["up", "up", "up", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Breaking the "SKULL IS KILL" Rule:**
   - **Action:** `"up", "up", "up"`
   - **Purpose:** From our starting position at `[2,5]`, we move up three times to `[2,8]`. The first two moves bring us to `[2,7]`, and the third move pushes the `is_word` from `[2,7]` to `[2,8]`.
   - **Result:** By pushing the `is_word` out of alignment, we break the rule `"skull_word is_word kill_word"`, effectively disabling the "SKULL IS KILL" rule. This allows us to pass through skulls without dying.

2. **Moving Towards the Flag:**
   - **Action:** `"down"`
   - **Purpose:** We move back down to `[2,7]` to begin our journey towards the flag.
   
3. **Navigating to the Flag:**
   - **Action:** `"right", "right", "right", "right"`
   - **Purpose:**
     - Move from `[2,7]` to `[6,7]` by moving right four times.
     - Since we've broken the "SKULL IS KILL" rule, passing through any skulls in our path does not harm us.
     - Note: If we encounter `kill_word` at `[3,7]`, we can push it aside as it's a pushable object.

4. **Reaching the Flag:**
   - **Action:** `"down"`
   - **Purpose:** From `[6,7]`, we move down to `[6,6]`, and then to `[6,5]`, where the `flag_obj` is located.
   - **Result:** Overlapping with the `flag_obj` triggers the "FLAG IS WIN" rule, and we win the level.

**Summary:**

- By breaking the "SKULL IS KILL" rule, we nullify the threat posed by the skulls.
- We carefully navigate from our starting position to the flag, utilizing the broken rule to pass through obstacles.
- The sequence of actions aligns with the high-level plan:
  - **Break the rule**: Done by pushing `is_word` out of alignment.
  - **Move to the flag**: By navigating rightwards and then down to the flag's position.
- Executing this action sequence results in winning the level.
