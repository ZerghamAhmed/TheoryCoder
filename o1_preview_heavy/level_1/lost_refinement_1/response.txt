```Python

["right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "right", "down", "down", "down"]

```

Explanation:

In my previous attempt, after forming the rule `'flag_word is_word win_word'`, I moved `baba_obj` back down along the same path and then moved right to position `[7, 3]`. However, this position is one tile above the `flag_obj` located at `[7, 4]`. Since the `flag_obj` becomes an overlappable and winning object after forming the rule, `baba_obj` needs to overlap with it to win the game.

To correct this, after forming the rule, instead of moving back down to `[6, 3]`, I should move `baba_obj` directly to the right to `[7, 7]` and then move down three times to reach `[7, 4]`, overlapping with the `flag_obj`. This sequence allows `baba_obj` to overlap with the `flag_obj` and triggers the win condition.

By adjusting the action sequence to:
- Move `baba_obj` right after forming the rule (to `[7, 7]`)
- Move down three times (to `[7, 4]`)

I ensure that `baba_obj` overlaps with `flag_obj` and the game is won.
