```Python

["right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "down", "down", "down", "down", "right"]

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Move to 'flag_word':**
   - Starting at `[2, 4]`, `baba_obj` moves right four times and up once to reach `[6, 5]`, the position of `flag_word`.
     - Actions: `"right", "right", "right", "right", "up"`
     - Positions:
       - `[2, 4]` → `[3, 4]` (right)
       - `[3, 4]` → `[4, 4]` (right)
       - `[4, 4]` → `[5, 4]` (right)
       - `[5, 4]` → `[6, 4]` (right)
       - `[6, 4]` → `[6, 5]` (up)

2. **Form the rule 'flag is win':**
   - `baba_obj` pushes `flag_word` upwards three times to align it with `is_word` at `[7, 8]` and `win_word` at `[8, 8]`, forming the rule **"flag is win"**.
     - Actions: `"up", "up", "up"`
     - Positions:
       - `[6, 5]` → `[6, 6]` (up), pushing `flag_word` to `[6, 6]`
       - `[6, 6]` → `[6, 7]` (up), pushing `flag_word` to `[6, 7]`
       - `[6, 7]` → `[6, 8]` (up), pushing `flag_word` to `[6, 8]`

3. **Move to 'flag_obj' and win:**
   - With the rule formed, `baba_obj` moves down four times and right once to reach `flag_obj` at `[7, 4]`. Since **"flag is win"** is active, touching the `flag_obj` results in winning the level.
     - Actions: `"down", "down", "down", "down", "right"`
     - Positions:
       - `[6, 8]` → `[6, 7]` (down)
       - `[6, 7]` → `[6, 6]` (down)
       - `[6, 6]` → `[6, 5]` (down)
       - `[6, 5]` → `[6, 4]` (down)
       - `[6, 4]` → `[7, 4]` (right)

**Summary:**

- By rearranging the words to form the rule **"flag is win"**, we change the property of the `flag_obj` to be a winning condition.
- Moving `baba_obj` to the `flag_obj` under this rule causes the game to be won.
- The action sequence efficiently accomplishes these tasks within the constraints of the game world.
