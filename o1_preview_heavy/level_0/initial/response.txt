```Python

["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]

```

**Explanation:**

In order to win the level, the goal is for `baba_obj` to reach `flag_obj` since the active rules are `'baba_word is_word you_word'` (which means Baba is controllable) and `'flag_word is_word win_word'` (which means touching the flag wins the game).

- **Initial Positions:**
  - **Baba's position:** `[2, 4]`
  - **Flag's position:** `[7, 4]`
  
- **Strategy:**
  - Move Baba horizontally from x-coordinate `2` to `7`, keeping the y-coordinate constant at `4`.
  - Since there are no obstacles or borders between these positions (as per the `border` and `pushables` in the initial state), Baba can move freely.
  
- **Action Sequence:**
  - **5 "right" moves**, each increasing the x-coordinate by `1`:
    1. Move to `[3, 4]`
    2. Move to `[4, 4]`
    3. Move to `[5, 4]`
    4. Move to `[6, 4]`
    5. Move to `[7, 4]` (Baba now overlaps with the flag)
    
- **Outcome:**
  - Upon reaching `[7, 4]`, Baba overlaps with the flag.
  - The rule `'flag_word is_word win_word'` means that touching the flag results in a win.
  - Therefore, this action sequence will result in winning the level.
