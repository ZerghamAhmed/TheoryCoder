Human: 
You are an AI agent that must come up with a list of actions that need to be taken to win a certain level in a game. 
These actions can only come from the action space given below. You are given an example of what your response 
format for this list of actions should look like. You will also need to provide your reasoning for why this will allow you to win.

You are given your current state that you start from in the level. As well as a domain file that describes high level concepts 
that you come into the game with. You have previously used this domain file to return a high-level plan that will allow you to win the level.
Remember you cannot execute the operators from this file, so you will need to figure out 
the low level action sequence composed of (up, left, right, down) 
that will allow you to achieve this high-level plan.

The high-level plan sometimes has entity_x where x denotes the index of that entity in the state dictionary.
example: (entity_1 is state[entity][0] and entity_2 is state[entity][1], etc.)

You are also given a world model in the form of python code that gives you information about what happens when you move (up, left, right, down).

So using the information please return the action sequence that will result in winning the level. 
Make sure to give your explanation, also
make sure to just have a seperate section with your actions as demonstrated in the response format.

ACTION SPACE (YOUR LIST SHOULD BE COMPOSED OF THESE ACTIONS ONLY):

['up', 'down', 'left', 'right']

STATE FORMAT:

\{
    <object 1>: [(x, y)],  # some object class and its location
    <object 2>: [(x, y), ...],  # some other object class and its locations
    ...  # etc.
    'lost': <bool>,  # Whether game has been lost yet
    'won': <bool>,  # Whether game has been won yet
\}

HIGH-LEVEL PLAN:

['break_rule wall_word is_word stop_word', 'move_to baba_obj_1 flag_obj_1']
