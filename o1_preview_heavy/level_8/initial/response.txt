Explanation:

We start at position `[5,4]` controlling `baba_obj`. Our high-level plan consists of two steps: first, break the rule `'wall_word is_word stop_word'` to make walls passable, and second, move `baba_obj` to the flag at position `[5,8]`.

**Step 1: Break the Rule `'Wall Is Stop'`**

- **Action:** `"left"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[5,4]` to `[4,4]`.
- **Action:** `"left"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[4,4]` to `[3,4]`.
- **Action:** `"left"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[3,4]` to `[2,4]`.
  - At `[2,4]`, there is `is_word`. Since `is_word` is in the `pushables` list, `baba_obj` pushes `is_word` from `[2,4]` to `[1,4]`.
  - This disrupts the vertical arrangement of `'wall_word is_word stop_word'` located at positions `[2,5]`, `[2,4]`, and `[2,3]`. The rule is now broken because `is_word` is no longer in the required position.

**Step 2: Move to the Flag**

With `'Wall Is Stop'` broken, walls are no longer impassable, allowing `baba_obj` to pass through them.

- **Action:** `"right"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[2,4]` to `[3,4]`.
- **Action:** `"up"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[3,4]` to `[3,5]`.
- **Action:** `"up"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[3,5]` to `[3,6]` (passes through a `wall_obj` at `[3,6]`).
- **Action:** `"up"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[3,6]` to `[3,7]`.
- **Action:** `"up"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[3,7]` to `[3,8]`.
- **Action:** `"right"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[3,8]` to `[4,8]`.
- **Action:** `"right"`
  - **Result:** `baba_obj` moves from `[4,8]` to `[5,8]`, which is where the `flag_obj` is located.

**Winning the Level**

Upon reaching the `flag_obj` at `[5,8]`, we satisfy the winning condition because:

- The rule `'flag_word is_word win_word'` is still formed, meaning the flag is designated as the winning object.
- The rule `'baba_word is_word you_word'` is still active, so we control `baba_obj`.
- Touching the flag with `baba_obj` triggers the win condition.

**Conclusion**

This action sequence effectively breaks the wall's stopping property and navigates `baba_obj` to the flag, resulting in a win.
