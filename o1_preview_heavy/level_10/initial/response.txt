```Python

["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "left", "up", "right", "up", "up", "right", "up", "up"]

```

Explanation:

Starting from the initial state, our goal is to first break the rule `goop_word is_word sink_word` to disable the "goop is sink" property, allowing Baba to safely cross the goop tiles. Then, we need to move Baba to the flag to win the level.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**

1. **Move Down 4 times** (`["down", "down", "down", "down"]`):
   - From position `[2,6]`, moving down to `[2,5]`, `[2,4]`, `[2,3]`, and then `[2,2]`. This brings Baba closer to the `goop_word` located at `[6,2]`, while avoiding the goop tiles.

2. **Move Right 4 times** (`["right", "right", "right", "right"]`):
   - From `[2,2]`, moving right to `[3,2]`, `[4,2]`, `[5,2]`, and then `[6,2]`. At `[6,2]`, Baba encounters the `goop_word`.

3. **Push `goop_word` Up**:
   - By moving right into `[6,2]`, Baba pushes the `goop_word` up to `[6,3]`, breaking the `goop_word is_word sink_word` rule since the words are no longer aligned. Now, "goop is sink" is no longer in effect.

4. **Move Left and Up** (`["left", "up"]`):
   - Move left to `[5,2]`, then up to `[5,3]` to reposition Baba to push the `goop_word` further out of the way.

5. **Push `goop_word` Right** (`["right"]`):
   - From `[5,3]`, move right to `[6,3]`, pushing the `goop_word` to `[7,3]`. This clears Baba's path upward.

6. **Move Up 2 times** (`["up", "up"]`):
   - From `[6,3]`, move up to `[6,4]` and `[6,5]`. Even though these positions contain `goop_obj`, it's safe because "goop is sink" has been broken.

7. **Move Right** (`["right"]`):
   - From `[6,5]`, move right to `[7,5]`.

8. **Move Up 2 times** (`["up", "up"]`):
   - From `[7,5]`, move up to `[7,6]` and then to `[7,7]`, where the `flag_obj` is located.

**Outcome:**

By following this sequence, Baba reaches the flag without being sunk by the goop tiles. Breaking the "goop is sink" rule allows Baba to safely cross the goop, and overlapping with the flag results in winning the level, as per the rule `'flag_word is_word win_word'` in the initial state.
