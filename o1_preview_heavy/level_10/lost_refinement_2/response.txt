```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **Break the "Goop is Sink" Rule:**
   - **Actions:** `down`, `down`, `down`, `down`, `right`, `right`, `right`, `right`, `up`
   - **Details:**
     - Starting from `baba_obj` at position `[2,6]`, we move **down** four times to reach `[2,2]`. This path avoids all `goop_obj` instances.
     - We then move **right** four times to reach `[6,2]`, where the `goop_word` is located.
     - At `[6,2]`, we perform an **up** action to push the `goop_word` from `[6,2]` to `[6,3]`. This disrupts the alignment of the words forming the rule `"goop_word is_word sink_word"`, effectively breaking the rule.
     - With the "Goop is Sink" rule broken, `goop_obj` no longer has the "Sink" property, allowing us to pass through them safely.

2. **Move to the Flag and Win the Game:**
   - **Actions:** `up`, `up`, `up`, `right`, `up`
   - **Details:**
     - From `[6,3]`, we move **up** three times, passing through positions `[6,4]`, `[6,5]`, and `[6,6]`. Even though `goop_obj` are present at `[6,4]` and `[6,5]`, they are no longer dangerous due to the broken rule.
     - We then move **right** to `[7,6]`. This position is adjacent to the `flag_obj` at `[7,7]`.
     - Finally, we move **up** to `[7,7]`, overlapping with the `flag_obj`.
     - Since the rule `"flag_word is_word win_word"` is still active, and `baba_obj` is "You", overlapping with the flag results in winning the game.

**Why This Works:**

- **Breaking the Hazardous Rule:** By disrupting the "Goop is Sink" rule, we remove the hazardous "Sink" property from all `goop_obj` instances. This allows Baba to pass through them without losing the game.

- **Direct Path to the Goal:** After breaking the rule, we take the most direct path to the flag, moving through the previously dangerous `goop_obj` spaces.

- **Winning Condition Met:** Overlapping `baba_obj` with `flag_obj` while the "Flag is Win" rule is active results in winning the game.

This corrected action sequence effectively implements the high-level plan, allowing you to win the level.
