```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "down", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "up"]
```

Explanation:

We start by executing the first part of the high-level plan: **break the rule "goop is sink"**. To do this, we need to disrupt the alignment of the words forming this rule on the grid.

1. **Move Down x4**: We move Baba from the initial position `[2,6]` down to `[2,2]`.
2. **Move Up**: We step back up to `[2,3]` to position ourselves for the next move.
3. **Move Right x4**: We proceed right to `[6,3]`.
4. **Move Down**: At `[6,3]`, we move down into `[6,2]`, pushing the `goop_word` from `[6,2]` down to `[6,1]`. This breaks the alignment of `goop_word is_word sink_word`, effectively breaking the rule "goop is sink".

With the "goop is sink" rule broken, the goop tiles no longer cause Baba to sink, allowing us to safely traverse them.

5. **Move Up x4**: We navigate upwards through positions `[6,3]` to `[6,6]`. This path includes stepping on `goop_obj` tiles at `[6,4]` and `[6,5]`, which is now safe.
6. **Move Right**: From `[6,6]`, we move right to `[7,6]`.
7. **Move Up**: Finally, we move up to `[7,7]`, overlapping with the `flag_obj`.

Reaching the flag completes the second part of the high-level plan: **move to the flag**. Overlapping with the `flag_obj` while the rule "flag is win" is active causes us to win the game.

This corrected action sequence allows us to:

- **Break the dangerous rule** that was causing us to lose when touching goop.
- **Safely navigate through the goop tiles** without losing.
- **Reach the flag** and win the level.
