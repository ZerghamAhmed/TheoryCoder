["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "down", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right"]

```

**Explanation:**

In this corrected action sequence, Baba first moves down four times from its initial position at `[2, 6]` to reach `[2, 2]`. This path avoids the `goop_obj` tiles that would cause Baba to be lost due to the "goop is sink" rule.

Actions:
- **Down, Down, Down, Down:** Moves Baba from `[2, 6]` to `[2, 2]`.

Next, Baba moves right four times to reach the position of `goop_word` at `[6, 2]`.

- **Right, Right, Right, Right:** Moves Baba from `[2, 2]` to `[6, 2]`.

At `[6, 2]`, Baba pushes `goop_word` down by moving down once, which moves `goop_word` to `[6, 1]` and breaks the "goop is sink" rule since the words are no longer aligned. Breaking this rule prevents Baba from being lost when overlapping `goop_obj` tiles.

- **Down:** Pushes `goop_word` from `[6, 2]` to `[6, 1]`, breaking the "goop is sink" rule.

Now, Baba moves up six times to navigate through the `goop_obj` tiles without being lost. Since the "goop is sink" rule is broken, Baba can safely pass through these tiles.

- **Up, Up, Up, Up, Up, Up:** Moves Baba from `[6, 1]` to `[6, 7]` through `goop_obj` tiles.

Finally, Baba moves right once to reach the `flag_obj` at `[7, 7]`. Since the "flag is win" rule is still active, overlapping the flag causes the game to be won.

- **Right:** Moves Baba from `[6, 7]` to `[7, 7]`, overlapping the flag.

**Summary:**
- By following this action sequence, Baba successfully breaks the "goop is sink" rule and avoids being lost.
- Baba navigates through the `goop_obj` tiles safely after breaking the rule.
- Baba reaches and overlaps the `flag_obj`, winning the game as per the "flag is win" rule.
