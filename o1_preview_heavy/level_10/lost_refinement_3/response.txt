```

Explanation:

In this action sequence, we aim to first break the rule `goop_word is_word sink_word` to disable the "sink" property of the goop objects, allowing us to safely traverse over them. Then, we move Baba to the Flag to win the game.

**Steps:**

1. **Move Baba to the position of `is_word` at `[7, 2]`:**
   - **Actions:** `["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]`
   - From the starting position `[2, 6]`, we move down four times to `[2, 2]`.
   - Then, we move right five times to reach `[7, 2]`, where `is_word` is located.

2. **Break the rule by pushing `is_word` down:**
   - **Action:** `["down"]`
   - We push `is_word` from `[7, 2]` to `[7, 1]`.
   - This breaks the alignment of `goop_word is_word sink_word`, effectively removing the "sink" property from all goop objects.

3. **Move Baba to the Flag position `[7, 7]`:**
   - **Actions:** `["up", "up", "up", "up", "up"]`
   - From `[7, 1]`, we move up five times.
   - During this path, we may pass over goop objects, but since they no longer have the "sink" property, they do not cause any harm.
   - We reach the Flag at `[7, 7]`, and since the rule `flag_word is_word win_word` is still active, overlapping Baba with the Flag results in winning the game.

**Why this action sequence works:**

- **Breaking the Sink Rule:** By pushing `is_word` down, we disrupt the formation of the rule `goop_word is_word sink_word`, thereby removing the "sink" attribute from goop objects. This allows Baba to safely move over goop tiles without being destroyed.
  
- **Path to the Flag:** With the sink property removed from goop objects, the direct path to the Flag is now unobstructed. Moving upwards from `[7, 1]` to `[7, 7]` allows Baba to reach the Flag without any hindrances.

**Conclusion:**

This action sequence corrects the previous attempts by specifically targeting the `is_word` tile to break the sink rule, rather than pushing other words which might have unintended consequences. By doing so, we ensure that the path to the Flag is safe and that the rules necessary for winning (`baba_word is_word you_word` and `flag_word is_word win_word`) remain intact.
