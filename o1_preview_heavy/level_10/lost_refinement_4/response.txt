Explanation:

To win the level, we need to break the rule "goop_word is_word sink_word" and then move Baba to the flag. Here's how the action sequence achieves this:

1. **Breaking the Rule**:

   - **Actions 1-8 ("down" x4, "right" x4)**: Move Baba from its initial position `[2,6]` down to `[2,2]` and then right to `[6,2]`, which is the location of "goop_word".
   - **Action 9 ("up")**: Push "goop_word" upward from `[6,2]` to `[6,3]`. This breaks the horizontal alignment of "goop_word", "is_word", and "sink_word", effectively breaking the rule "goop_word is_word sink_word". Now, Goop is no longer Sink, so Baba can safely move over Goop tiles.

2. **Reaching the Flag**:

   - **Actions 10-13 ("up" x4)**: Move Baba upward from `[6,2]` to `[6,6]`. Since Goop is no longer Sink, Baba can move over any Goop tiles encountered.
   - **Action 14 ("right")**: Move Baba to `[7,6]`.
   - **Action 15 ("up")**: Move Baba to `[7,7]`, where the Flag is located. Since "flag_word is_word win_word" is a rule, touching the Flag with Baba results in winning the level.

This action sequence ensures that the harmful "Goop is Sink" rule is broken before attempting to cross any Goop tiles. By pushing "goop_word" out of alignment, we disable the Sink property of Goop, allowing Baba to reach the Flag without being destroyed.
