### Explanation:

**Objective**: To execute the high-level plan:
1. **Form the rule** `keke_word is_word you_word` to gain control over Keke.
2. **Move Keke** (now controllable) to the flag to win the level.

**Step-by-Step Actions**:

1. **Navigate Baba to the words:**

   - **Action**: `"left", "left", "left"`  
     **Result**: Baba moves from `[6,4]` to `[3,4]`, positioning to interact with `keke_word`.
   - **Action**: `"down", "down"`  
     **Result**: Baba moves down to `[3,2]`, near `you_word` and `is_word`.

2. **Position `you_word`:**

   - **Action**: `"left", "left"`  
     **Result**: Baba moves to `[1,2]`, left of `is_word` at `[2,2]`.
   - **Action**: `"right"`  
     **Result**: Baba pushes `is_word` from `[2,2]` to `[3,2]`.
   - **Action**: `"up"`  
     **Result**: Baba moves to `[3,3]`.
   - **Action**: `"right"`  
     **Result**: Baba moves to `[4,3]`, positioning to push `you_word` up.
   - **Action**: `"up", "up"`  
     **Result**: Baba pushes `you_word` from `[3,2]` up to `[3,4]`, aligning it with `keke_word`.

3. **Align the words to form the rule:**

   - **Action**: `"right", "right"`  
     **Result**: Baba moves to `[5,4]`, right of `keke_word` at `[3,4]`.
   - **Action**: `"down", "down", "down", "down"`  
     **Result**: Baba moves down to `[5,0]` to come around.
   - **Action**: `"right", "right"`  
     **Result**: Baba moves to `[7,0]`, preparing to push `is_word` down.
   - **Action**: `"up", "up"`  
     **Result**: Baba pushes `is_word` from `[8,4]` down to `[8,2]`, breaking existing rules if necessary.

4. **Gain control over Keke:**

   - **Action**: `"right", "right"`  
     **Result**: Baba moves to `[9,2]`, but since `[9,x]` is a border, this step ensures the rules update.
   - **Action**: `"up", "up", "up"`  
     **Result**: Baba cannot proceed further due to borders, but at this point, `keke_word is_word you_word` is formed, and Keke becomes controllable.

5. **Switch control to Keke and move to the flag:**

   - **Action**: Switch to controlling Keke.
   - **Keke's Actions**: Move from `keke_obj` position `[3,7]` to the flag at `[6,7]`.
     - **Actions**: `"right", "right", "right"`  
       **Result**: Keke moves to `[6,7]`, overlapping with the flag.

**Outcome**:

By forming the rule `keke is you`, control switches to Keke. Moving Keke to the flag results in winning the level because `flag is win` is already an active rule.

The sequence of actions involves carefully moving Baba to rearrange the words without violating any game constraints. The actions aim to:

- Rearrange `is_word` and `you_word` to align with `keke_word`.
- Form the new rule to gain control over Keke.
- Navigate Keke to the flag to win the game.
