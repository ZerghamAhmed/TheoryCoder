```Python
["right", "down", "right", "left", "up", "left", "up", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

In this action sequence, we aim to break the rule **"wall_word is_word stop_word"** to allow **Baba** to pass through the walls and reach the flag.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **"right"**: Move Baba from `[6, 4]` to `[7, 4]`.
   - **Reason**: Get closer to the **"stop_word"** at `[8, 3]`.

2. **"down"**: Move Baba from `[7, 4]` to `[7, 3]`.
   - **Reason**: Align with the **"stop_word"** horizontally.

3. **"right"**: Move Baba from `[7, 3]` to `[8, 3]`, pushing the **"stop_word"** down to `[8, 2]`.
   - **Effect**: Breaks the **"wall_word is_word stop_word"** rule because the words are no longer aligned vertically.
   - **Reason**: Without the **"STOP"** property, walls become passable.

4. **"left"**: Move Baba from `[8, 3]` back to `[7, 3]`.
   - **Reason**: Start returning towards the wall to pass through it.

5. **"up"**: Move Baba from `[7, 3]` to `[7, 4]`.
   - **Reason**: Continue moving back towards the starting position.

6. **"left"**: Move Baba from `[7, 4]` to `[6, 4]`.
   - **Reason**: Position Baba directly below where we need to move up through the wall.

7. **"up"**: Move Baba from `[6, 4]` to `[6, 5]`.
   - **Reason**: Begin moving through where the wall was previously impassable.

8. **"up"**: Move Baba from `[6, 5]` to `[6, 6]`.
   - **Effect**: Pass through the wall at `[6, 6]` since walls no longer stop Baba.
   - **Reason**: Get closer to the flag.

9. **"up"**: Move Baba from `[6, 6]` to `[6, 7]`, overlapping with the **"flag_obj"**.
   - **Effect**: Since **"flag_word is_word win_word"** is active, overlapping with the flag causes the game to be won.
   - **Reason**: Achieve the goal of winning the level.

**Why This Action Sequence Works:**

- By moving the **"stop_word"** out of alignment, we effectively dismantle the **"WALL IS STOP"** rule. This allows Baba to pass through walls, which are no longer obstacles.
  
- We avoid disturbing the **"BABA IS YOU"** rule, ensuring we retain control of Baba throughout the sequence.
  
- We leverage existing rules (**"FLAG IS WIN"**) to win the game upon reaching the flag.

**Summary:**

This sequence efficiently achieves the high-level plan by modifying the game rules to our advantage, allowing Baba to reach the flag and win the level without unnecessary complexity or risk of losing control.
