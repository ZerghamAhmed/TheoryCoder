```Python
["right", "right", "up", "up", "left", "left", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:

In this action sequence, we navigate Baba to reach the Flag directly, bypassing the need to change the control to Keke. Here are the steps:

1. **Right, Right**: Move Baba from `(6,4)` to `(8,4)`.
2. **Up, Up**: Move Baba to `(8,6)` (we can pass through `(8,5)` since there is no wall blocking upward movement at `(8,5)`).
3. **Left, Left**: Move Baba to `(6,6)`. Though there is a wall at `(6,6)`, since we're moving horizontally at the same `y` coordinate where walls are, this movement is allowed.
4. **Up, Up, Up**: Move Baba upward to reach `(6,9)`. Since our `flag_obj` is at `(6,7)`, Baba passes through this point during these moves.
   
By moving Baba directly to the Flag's location, we can win the game without altering the current control rules or forming new ones. This approach avoids the complexities involved in changing control to Keke and the risk of losing control due to breaking existing rules.
