["right", "right", "down", "up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "up"]

```

Explanation:

In the previous attempts, the agent tried to form the rule **"keke is you"** by manipulating the words in the game. However, moving the `you_word` from its original position broke the existing rule **"baba is you"** before establishing the new rule. This resulted in losing the game because there were no controllable characters left.

To correct this, we avoid altering the **"baba is you"** rule altogether. Instead, we focus on breaking the **"wall is stop"** rule to allow **Baba** to reach the **flag** directly. Here's how the action sequence achieves this:

1. **Move Right (x2):** Baba moves from `[6,4]` to `[7,4]`, then to `[8,4]`.
2. **Move Down:** Baba moves to `[8,3]` and pushes the `stop_word` from `[8,3]` to `[8,2]`.
3. **Breaking the Rule:** By pushing `stop_word` down, the **"wall is stop"** rule is broken since the words are no longer aligned. Walls are no longer impassable.
4. **Move Up (x3):** Baba moves back up to `[8,6]`, passing through walls which are now passable.
5. **Move Left (x2):** Baba moves from `[8,6]` to `[6,6]`.
6. **Move Up:** Baba moves to `[6,7]`, where the `flag_obj` is located.

By overlapping with the `flag_obj` at `[6,7]`, Baba wins the game. This sequence ensures that the controllable character remains active throughout the process and leverages the game's mechanics to reach the goal without breaking critical rules prematurely.
