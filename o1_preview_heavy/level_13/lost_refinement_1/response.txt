```Python
["up", "left", "left", "left", "down", "down", "left", "up", "right", "down", "down", "right", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

Explanation:

In the previous attempt, the game was lost because moving down caused 'you_word' to be moved from its position at [3,2], breaking the rule 'baba_word is_word you_word'. This resulted in 'baba' no longer being controllable before establishing 'keke_word is_word you_word', leading to a loss.

To correct this, we must avoid moving 'you_word' until 'keke_word is_word you_word' is formed. Here's how the corrected action sequence achieves this:

1. **Avoid Pushing 'you_word':** We ensure that 'you_word' at [3,2] remains in place to keep 'baba' controllable.

2. **Position 'keke_word' to Form 'keke is you':**
   - **Actions:** `"up", "left", "left", "left", "down", "down", "left"`
   - **Outcome:** Moves 'baba_obj' to [2,4], allowing us to push 'keke_word' right along row 4 without disturbing 'you_word'.

3. **Push 'keke_word' Right to Align with 'is_word':**
   - **Actions:** `"up", "right"`
   - **Outcome:** Pushes 'keke_word' from [3,4] to [4,4], then to [5,4], aligning it horizontally.

4. **Move 'is_word' Left to Complete the Rule:**
   - **Actions:** `"down", "down", "right"`
   - **Outcome:** Moves 'is_word' from [8,4] to [7,4], then to [6,4], aligning with 'keke_word'.

5. **Form 'keke is you' Rule:**
   - **Actions:** `"right"`
   - **Outcome:** Pushes 'is_word' to [5,4], forming 'keke_word is_word'.

6. **Shift Control to 'keke_obj':**
   - **Actions:** `"up", "up"`
   - **Outcome:** With 'keke is you' formed, control shifts to 'keke_obj' at [3,7].

7. **Move 'keke_obj' to 'flag_obj':**
   - **Actions:** `"right", "right", "up", "up", "up"`
   - **Outcome:** Moves 'keke_obj' from [3,7] to [6,7], reaching 'flag_obj' and winning the game.

This corrected sequence successfully forms the high-level plan:
- **Form 'keke is you'** without breaking existing rules prematurely.
- **Move 'keke' to 'flag'** to win the level.

By carefully avoiding the movement of 'you_word' and executing actions that align the necessary words to form the new rule, we prevent the loss condition and achieve the objective.
