```Python
["down", "down", "down", "left", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:

In this action sequence, we first move Baba down three times ('down', 'down', 'down') to reach position [2,3]. Then, we move left ('left') to position [1,3], where the 'goop_word' is located. By moving right ('right') from this position, we push the 'goop_word' from [1,3] to [2,3], disrupting the alignment of the words forming the rule 'goop_word is_word sink_word'. 

Breaking this rule means that 'goop_obj' is no longer associated with the 'sink' property. Consequently, Baba can safely move over the 'goop_obj' tiles without triggering the 'lost' condition.

After breaking the rule, we move Baba up four times ('up', 'up', 'up', 'up') to navigate through the former 'sink' tiles safely, reaching position [1,7]. Here, Baba is aligned horizontally with the 'flag_obj'.

Finally, we move Baba right six times ('right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right') to reach the 'flag_obj' at position [7,7]. Since the rule 'flag_word is_word win_word' is still formed, overlapping Baba with the 'flag_obj' triggers the win condition, and the game is won.

This corrected action sequence allows Baba to reach the flag without losing the game, addressing the issues encountered in previous attempts where Baba overlapped with 'goop_obj' while it was still 'sink' and lost the game.
