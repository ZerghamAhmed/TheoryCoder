```

**Explanation:**

The previous attempts failed because stepping onto the `goop_obj` resulted in `baba_obj` sinking due to the rule `'goop_word is_word sink_word'`. To successfully reach the `flag_obj`, we need to negate or break this rule so that `baba_obj` can safely traverse over the goop tiles.

**Steps Breakdown:**

1. **Move Down to the Bottom Left Corner:**
   - `down`, `down`, `down`, `down`: Moves `baba_obj` from `(2,6)` to `(2,2)`.
  
2. **Push 'is_word' Out of Alignment:**
   - `left`: Moves `baba_obj` to `(1,2)` and pushes `is_word` from `(1,2)` to `(2,2)`.
   - This disrupts the vertical alignment of `'goop_word is_word sink_word'`, effectively breaking the rule.

3. **Push 'sink_word' Out of Alignment:**
   - `down`: Moves `baba_obj` to `(1,1)`.
   - `up`: Pushes `sink_word` from `(1,1)` to `(1,2)`, further ensuring the rule is broken.

4. **Return to Starting Position:**
   - `right`: Moves `baba_obj` to `(2,1)`.
   - `up`, `up`, `up`, `up`, `up`: Moves `baba_obj` back up to `(2,6)`.

5. **Traverse Over Goop to Reach the Flag:**
   - `right`, `right`, `right`, `right`: Moves `baba_obj` from `(2,6)` to `(6,6)`, crossing goop tiles without sinking since the sink rule is broken.
   - `up`: Moves `baba_obj` to `(6,7)`.
   - `right`: Moves `baba_obj` to `(7,7)`, where the `flag_obj` is located.

**Why This Works:**

- **Breaking the 'Goop is Sink' Rule:** By pushing `is_word` and `sink_word` out of alignment, the rule `'goop_word is_word sink_word'` is no longer formed. This means `goop_obj` no longer causes `baba_obj` to sink, allowing safe passage over goop tiles.

- **Direct Path to the Flag:** With the sink rule broken, `baba_obj` can traverse directly over the goop tiles that previously blocked the path to the `flag_obj`.

- **Winning the Game:** Upon reaching the `flag_obj` at `(7,7)` and overlapping with it, and since the rule `'flag_word is_word win_word'` is still in effect, the game is won.
