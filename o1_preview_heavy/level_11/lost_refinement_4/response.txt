```Python
["down", "down", "down", "left", "right", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "up", "right", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:

In this action sequence, we start by moving Baba downward three times to reach position [2,3]. Here's the step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Actions 1-3 (`"down", "down", "down"`):** Move Baba from [2,6] to [2,3].
2. **Action 4 (`"left"`):** Move left to [1,3], where the `goop_word` is located.
3. **Action 5 (`"right"`):** Push the `goop_word` from [1,3] to [2,3], breaking the rule `goop_word is_word sink_word`. This means `goop` is no longer `sink`, and the goop objects become harmless.
4. **Actions 6-8 (`"up", "up", "up"`):** Move upward through the goop objects at positions [1,4], [1,5], and [1,6]. Since goop is no longer sink, Baba can safely pass through these tiles.
5. **Action 9 (`"right"`):** Move right to [2,6], returning to Baba's initial horizontal position.
6. **Actions 10-12 (`"right", "right", "right"`):** Move right through positions [3,6], [4,6], and [5,6], which may contain goop objects but are now safe.
7. **Action 13 (`"up"`):** Move up to [5,7], getting closer to the flag.
8. **Actions 14-15 (`"right", "right"`):** Move right to [6,7] and then to [7,7], where the `flag_obj` is located.

By reaching the `flag_obj` at [7,7], and since the rule `flag_word is_word win_word` is formed, Baba wins the game upon overlapping with the flag.

This corrected action sequence avoids the previous issue of Baba sinking in goop by first breaking the goop's sink property and then safely navigating through the goop to reach the flag.
