Explanation:

In the previous attempts, the agent lost the game because it could not reach the 'flag_obj' due to the 'goop_obj's, which act as sinks (destroying the player upon contact) because of the rule 'goop_word is_word sink_word'. To win the game, we need to disable this rule so that 'goop_obj's no longer act as sinks, allowing 'baba_obj' to pass through them safely.

Here's the corrected action sequence and reasoning:

1. **Move Down 4 times**: 
   - From `[2,6]` to `[2,2]`. This positions 'baba_obj' next to the 'is_word' at `[1,2]`, which is part of the rule 'goop is sink'.

2. **Move Left 1 time**: 
   - From `[2,2]` to `[1,2]`, where the 'is_word' is located.

3. **Move Down 1 time**: 
   - Pushes the 'is_word' from `[1,2]` down to `[1,1]`, overlapping with 'sink_word'. This breaks the adjacency required for the rule 'goop is sink' to be active, effectively disabling the 'goop is sink' rule.

4. **Move Up 6 times**: 
   - From `[1,1]` to `[1,7]`. Since 'goop' is no longer 'sink', 'baba_obj' can safely move through 'goop_obj's.

5. **Move Right 6 times**: 
   - From `[1,7]` to `[7,7]`, reaching the 'flag_obj'. With the rule 'flag is win' still active, touching the 'flag_obj' results in winning the game.

By disabling the 'goop is sink' rule, 'baba_obj' can traverse through the 'goop_obj's without being destroyed, allowing it to reach the 'flag_obj' and win the game.
