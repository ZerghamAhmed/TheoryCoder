```Python

['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'up']

```

**Explanation:**

In our previous attempt, moving directly towards the flag led us through the goop objects, which caused us to lose the game because the rule **"goop_word is_word sink_word"** was active, making all `goop_obj` act as sink tiles. When `baba_obj` overlaps with a sink tile, it results in a loss.

To correct this, we need to break the rule **"goop_word is_word sink_word"** so that `goop_obj` no longer function as sink tiles. Here's how the action sequence achieves this:

1. **Move Down Four Times ('down', 'down', 'down', 'down'):**
   - From our starting position `[2,6]`, we move down to reach `[2,2]`.
   - This positions us adjacent to the `is_word` at `[1,2]`.

2. **Move Left ('left'):**
   - We move left to `[1,2]`, where the `is_word` is located.

3. **Push 'is_word' Right ('right'):**
   - From `[1,2]`, we push the `is_word` to the right into `[2,2]`.
   - This breaks the vertical alignment of **"goop_word is_word sink_word"**, effectively disrupting the rule.
   - Now, `goop_obj` no longer have the sink property.

4. **Move Right and Up to Return to Original Path ('right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'up'):**
   - We move right to `[2,2]`, then up through `[2,3]`, `[2,4]`, `[2,5]`, and back to our starting row at `[2,6]`.

5. **Move Right Towards the Flag ('right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right'):**
   - From `[2,6]`, we move right five times to reach `[7,6]`.
   - Along the way, we pass through positions occupied by `goop_obj`. Since they no longer have the sink property, we can safely traverse them.

6. **Move Up to the Flag ('up'):**
   - From `[7,6]`, we move up to `[7,7]`, where the `flag_obj` is located.
   - Overlapping with the `flag_obj` causes us to win the game because the rule **"flag_word is_word win_word"** is active, and we are controlling `baba_obj` due to **"baba_word is_word you_word"**.

**Why This Works:**

- **Breaking the Sink Rule:** By pushing the `is_word` out of alignment, we break the rule that causes `goop_obj` to sink `baba_obj`. This allows us to move over `goop_obj` without losing.
  
- **Avoiding Obstacles:** After breaking the rule, we return to our original path and move directly towards the flag. Any `goop_obj` we encounter no longer pose a threat.

- **Winning Condition:** Reaching `[7,7]` where the `flag_obj` is, we satisfy the winning condition due to the active rule **"flag_word is_word win_word"**.

By adjusting our action sequence to first disrupt the sink rule and then proceeding to the flag, we avoid the previous loss condition and successfully win the level.
