**Explanation:**

To correct the previous action sequence and successfully win the level, we need to execute actions that align with our high-level plan: **['form_rule rock_word is_word flag_word', 'move_to baba_obj_1 flag_obj_1']**.

Hereâ€™s the step-by-step reasoning for the corrected action sequence:

1. **Move Baba towards 'rock_word':**

   - **Actions:** `"right", "right", "down", "down"`
   - **Resulting Position:** Baba moves from `[2,5]` to `[4,3]`, positioning Baba next to 'rock_word' at `[4,3]`.

2. **Push 'rock_word' towards 'is_word' and 'flag_word':**

   - **Actions:** `"right", "right"`
   - **Resulting Positions:**
     - Push 'rock_word' from `[4,3]` to `[6,3]`.
     - Baba moves to `[6,3]`.
   - **Note:** There are no obstacles, so 'rock_word' can be pushed right without issues.

3. **Move down to align 'rock_word' with 'is_word' and 'flag_word':**

   - **Actions:** `"down", "down"`
   - **Resulting Positions:**
     - Push 'rock_word' from `[6,3]` to `[6,1]`.
     - Baba moves to `[6,1]`.
   - **Note:** Now, 'rock_word' at `[6,1]` is aligned with 'is_word' at `[7,1]` and 'flag_word' at `[8,1]`, forming the rule **"rock is flag"**.

4. **Move towards the transformed 'flag_obj':**

   - **Actions:** `"left", "left", "down", "down"`
   - **Resulting Position:** Baba moves to `[4,1]`.
   - **Note:** This positions Baba closer to where the 'rock_obj' (now 'flag_obj') is located.

5. **Navigate to the 'flag_obj' to win the game:**

   - **Actions:** `"right", "right", "up", "up"`
   - **Resulting Position:** Baba moves to `[6,3]`, overlapping with the newly formed 'flag_obj' at `[7,5]`.
   - **Note:** Overlapping with 'flag_obj' while the rule **"flag is win"** is active results in winning the game.

**Why This Works:**

- **Forming the 'rock is flag' Rule:**
  - By pushing 'rock_word' to align with 'is_word' and 'flag_word', we create a new game rule that transforms all 'rock_obj' into 'flag_obj'. This is essential because there is no 'flag_obj' in the initial state; we need one to win the game.

- **Winning the Game:**
  - After the rule is formed, the 'rock_obj' at `[7,5]` becomes a 'flag_obj'. Since the rule **"flag is win"** is already present, moving Baba to the location of the new 'flag_obj' allows us to win the game.

**Key Points:**

- **Avoiding Obstacles:** This sequence carefully navigates around obstacles like the 'rock_obj' at `[7,5]` and ensures that Baba doesn't collide with unmovable objects.

- **Efficient Movement:** The actions are optimized to minimize unnecessary steps, focusing on achieving the high-level plan effectively.

- **Rule Formation Mechanics:** Understanding the game's mechanics of rule formation is crucial. Aligning the words correctly changes the properties of objects in the game world.

By following this action sequence, we successfully execute the high-level plan and win the level.
