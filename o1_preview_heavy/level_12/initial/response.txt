```Python

["right", "right", "down", "down", "up", "up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "left", "up"]

```

**Explanation:**

To achieve the high-level plan of breaking the rule `baba_word is_word melt_word` and then moving Baba to the flag, we need to carefully navigate Baba through the level while manipulating the words to alter the game rules.

1. **Breaking the Rule:**
   - **Action 1 - 2 (`"right", "right"`):** Move Baba from his starting position at `[5,4]` to `[7,4]`, positioning him next to the `melt_word` located at `[7,3]`.
   - **Action 3 - 4 (`"down", "down"`):** Move Baba down to `[7,3]` and push the `melt_word` down to `[7,2]`. This separates `melt_word` from the vertically aligned words `baba_word` at `[7,5]` and `is_word` at `[7,4]`, effectively breaking the `baba_word is_word melt_word` rule.

2. **Moving to the Flag:**
   - With the `melt` property removed from Baba, he can now safely cross the lava (which is `hot`) without melting.
   - **Action 5 - 8 (`"up", "up", "up", "up"`):** Move Baba back up through `[7,4]`, `[7,5]`, and `[7,6]` (even if he needs to push the `baba_word` upward, it's acceptable). Crossing `[7,6]` brings Baba across the lava row safely due to the broken `melt` rule.
   - **Action 9 - 11 (`"left", "left", "left"`):** Navigate Baba leftward from `[7,7]` to `[4,7]`, aligning him horizontally with the flag's column.
   - **Action 12 (`"up"`):** Move Baba up to `[4,8]`, where the `flag_obj` is located.

By following this sequence of actions, we successfully break the detrimental rule affecting Baba and guide him to the flag, resulting in winning the level.
