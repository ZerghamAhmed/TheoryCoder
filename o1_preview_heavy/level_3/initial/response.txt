```Python
["left", "left", "left", "left", "left"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the initial state, we control the `flag_obj` and `love_obj` because of the rule `"flag_word is_word you_word"` and `"love_word is_word you_word"`. Our goal is to move `flag_obj` to the position of `baba_obj` to win the game, as per the high-level plan `['move_to flag_obj_1 baba_obj_1']`.

- **Starting Position:**
  - `flag_obj` is at position **(7, 6)**.
  - `baba_obj` is at position **(2, 6)**.

To move `flag_obj` to `baba_obj`, we need to move left along the same row (y-coordinate remains 6) from x = 7 to x = 2. This requires **5 left moves**.

- **Action Sequence:**
  - Move left from (7, 6) to (6, 6).
  - Move left from (6, 6) to (5, 6).
  - Move left from (5, 6) to (4, 6).
  - Move left from (4, 6) to (3, 6).
  - Move left from (3, 6) to (2, 6).

By executing `["left", "left", "left", "left", "left"]`, `flag_obj` overlaps with `baba_obj` at position (2, 6).

- **Winning Condition:**
  - The rule `"baba_word is_word win_word"` means that `baba_obj` is a **win** object.
  - Since we control `flag_obj` (`flag` is **you**), overlapping it with a **win** object (`baba_obj`) results in winning the game.

**Therefore, moving `flag_obj` left 5 times to overlap with `baba_obj` allows us to win the level.**
