```Python
['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']
```

Explanation:

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it led Baba into a "goop_obj" tile at position [7,5], causing Baba to sink and lose the game. Specifically, after moving up from [7,4] to [7,5], Baba stepped into the goop and the game was lost.

To correct this, we need to avoid moving Baba into the goop. However, given the layout of the level and the positions of the goop tiles, there is no path for Baba to reach the flag at [7,7] without stepping into goop or modifying the rules.

Since we can't reach the flag directly, and we can't alter the rules (as the necessary words are inaccessible due to obstacles), the best we can do is move Baba as close as possible to the flag without stepping into goop. The corrected action sequence stops before making the move that causes the loss:

1. Move down four times to reach [2,2].
2. Move right five times to reach [7,2].

At this point, any further movement toward the flag would require stepping into goop, which would result in losing the game. Therefore, we stop the action sequence here to prevent losing.
