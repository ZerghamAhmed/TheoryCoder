```Python
["down", "down", "down", "left", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "right", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

To execute the high-level plan `['move_to baba_obj_1 flag_obj_1']`, we need to navigate Baba from its starting position at `[2, 6]` to the Flag at `[7, 7]`, while avoiding obstacles and hazardous tiles.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**

1. **Break the "Goop is Sink" Rule:**
   - **Move Down x3:** `["down", "down", "down"]`  
     From `[2, 6]` to `[2, 3]`.
   - **Move Left x1:** `["left"]`  
     From `[2, 3]` to `[1, 3]`.
   - **Action:** Push the `goop_word` at `[1, 3]` to the right into `[2, 3]`. This breaks the "Goop is Sink" rule, allowing Baba to safely cross Goop tiles.

2. **Navigate Through the Goop Area:**
   - **Move Up x3:** `["up", "up", "up"]`  
     From `[1, 3]` to `[1, 6]`, moving through now-safe Goop tiles.
   - **Move Right x5:** `["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]`  
     From `[1, 6]` to `[6, 6]`, crossing the Goop area horizontally.

3. **Reach the Flag:**
   - **Move Up x2:** `["up", "up"]`  
     From `[6, 6]` to `[6, 8]`.
   - **Move Right x1:** `["right"]`  
     From `[6, 8]` to `[7, 8]`.
   - **Move Down x1:** `["down"]`  
     From `[7, 8]` to `[7, 7]`, where the Flag is located.

**Considerations:**

- **Obstacles:** We avoided `goop_obj` tiles when they were hazardous and navigated through them only after breaking the "Goop is Sink" rule.
- **Pushable Objects:** Words like `goop_word` are pushable. Pushing `goop_word` breaks the rule.
- **Rules Formed:**
  - **Initial Rules:**
    - "Baba is You" (allows control of Baba).
    - "Flag is Win" (touching Flag results in a win).
    - "Goop is Sink" (Goop sinks anything that overlaps with it).
    - "Rock is Push" (Rocks can be pushed).
  - **After Breaking "Goop is Sink":** Goop no longer sinks Baba, making it safe to traverse.

By following these actions, Baba successfully reaches the Flag and wins the level.
