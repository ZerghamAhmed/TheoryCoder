```Python

["down", "down", "down", "down", "left", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up"]

```

Explanation:

In the previous action sequence, we attempted to move right from position [2,6] to [3,6], but this position contains a `goop_obj`. Since the rule "goop is sink" was active, moving onto a `goop_obj` caused `baba_obj` to sink, resulting in losing the game.

To correct this, we need to disable the "goop is sink" rule. The rule is formed by the alignment of `goop_word` at [1,3], `is_word` at [1,2], and `sink_word` at [1,1] vertically. By moving the `is_word` out of alignment, we can break the rule.

Here's how the corrected action sequence works:

1. **Move down four times** (`["down", "down", "down", "down"]`) to reach position [2,2].

2. **Move left once** (`["left"]`) to push the `is_word` from [1,2] to [2,2], breaking the "goop is sink" rule.

3. **Move right once** (`["right"]`) to return to [2,2].

4. **Move up four times** (`["up", "up", "up", "up"]`) to return to starting position [2,6].

5. **Move right five times** (`["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]`) to pass through previously dangerous `goop_obj` tiles, which are now harmless since "goop is sink" has been disabled.

6. **Move up once** (`["up"]`) to reach the `flag_obj` at [7,7] and win the game.

By breaking the "goop is sink" rule, we safely navigate through the `goop_obj` tiles to reach the flag without losing.
