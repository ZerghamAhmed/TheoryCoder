```Python
["up", "up", "left", "left", "down", "down", "right", "up", "up", "right", "up", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it moved **Baba** away from the **Flag** instead of towards it. Here's why:

1. **Starting Position:** Baba starts at position `[2,6]` and the Flag is at `[7,7]`.
2. **Previous Actions:** The sequence `['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']` moves Baba down to `[2,2]` and then right to `[7,2]`.
3. **Issue:** Baba ends up at `[7,2]`, which is far from the Flag at `[7,7]`. Moreover, obstacles block the path upwards from `[7,2]` to the Flag.

**Corrected Action Sequence Steps:**

1. **Move Up Twice:** `["up", "up"]`  
   - From `[2,6]` to `[2,8]`.
   - Pushes the `is_word` at `[2,7]` and `[2,8]` upwards.
2. **Move Left Twice:** `["left", "left"]`  
   - From `[2,8]` to `[0,8]`.
   - Navigates around obstacles by moving towards the left border.
3. **Move Down Twice:** `["down", "down"]`  
   - From `[0,8]` to `[0,6]`.
   - Positions Baba to avoid the `goop_obj` obstacles.
4. **Move Right and Up:** `["right", "up", "up"]`  
   - From `[0,6]` to `[1,8]`.
   - Moves towards the top edge to bypass obstacles.
5. **Move Right and Up:** `["right", "up"]`  
   - From `[1,8]` to `[2,9]`.
   - Note: Since `[2,9]` is the border, Baba cannot move here, but due to the game's mechanics, pushing into the border may allow for rule changes.
6. **Final Move Right:** `["right"]`  
   - From `[2,8]` to `[3,8]`.
   - Reaches the `win_word` and potentially forms a new rule.

**Note:** The corrected sequence attempts to manipulate the words on the board to form a new rule such as `Baba is Win` or `Flag is You`. By pushing the words into new positions, we can change the game's rules and win the level.

**Conclusion:**

- **Why Previous Sequence Failed:** It moved Baba away from the Flag and into a position where upward movement was blocked by obstacles.
- **Why Corrected Sequence Works:** It strategically moves Baba to manipulate the words and change the game rules, allowing for a path to victory.
