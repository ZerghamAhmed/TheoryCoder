```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right"]
```

Explanation:

The previous action sequence led to losing the game because Baba moved into a "goop" tile at position (8,5), which is designated as a sink in the game rules. Stepping onto a "goop" tile causes Baba to sink and the game to be lost.

In the corrected action sequence, we adjust Baba's path to avoid stepping into any "goop" tiles. After moving down and then right, instead of continuing to move up into the dangerous area with "goop" tiles, Baba moves right to navigate around the obstacles. This alternative route allows Baba to reach the flag at (7,7) without encountering the "goop", thereby winning the level.
