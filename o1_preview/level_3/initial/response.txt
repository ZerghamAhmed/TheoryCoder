```Python
["left", "left", "left", "left", "left"]
```

**Explanation:**

Given the initial state, the controllable objects are `flag_obj` and `love_obj`, due to the active rules "flag is you" and "love is you". The high-level plan is `['move_to flag_obj_1 baba_obj_1']`, which means we need to move the `flag_obj` to the location of `baba_obj`.

Here's how we can achieve this:

1. **Identify Positions:**
   - `flag_obj` is at position `[7, 6]`.
   - `baba_obj` is at position `[2, 6]`.

2. **Plan the Path:**
   - Move `flag_obj` from `[7, 6]` to `[2, 6]` by moving left 5 times.
   - The path is clear of obstacles since all intermediate positions `[6, 6]`, `[5, 6]`, `[4, 6]`, and `[3, 6]` are empty.

3. **Execute Moves:**
   - Perform the actions `["left", "left", "left", "left", "left"]` controlling the `flag_obj`.

4. **Winning the Game:**
   - Upon reaching `baba_obj`, since the rule "baba is win" is active, overlapping `flag_obj` with `baba_obj` results in winning the level.

By following these steps, we effectively translate the high-level plan into the necessary low-level actions to win the game.
