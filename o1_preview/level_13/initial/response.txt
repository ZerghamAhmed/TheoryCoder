```

**Explanation:**

To achieve the high-level plan of forming the rule `KEKE IS YOU` and then moving `keke_obj` to the `flag_obj`, we need to execute the following sequence of low-level actions:

1. **Move Baba Left thrice** to reach and push `keke_word` left:
   - `left` from `[6,4]` to `[5,4]`
   - `left` to `[4,4]`
   - `left` to `[3,4]`, pushing `keke_word` from `[3,4]` to `[2,4]`

2. **Navigate Baba to push `is_word` right, clearing the path at `[2,2]`**:
   - `down` to `[3,3]`
   - `left` to `[2,3]`
   - `down` to `[2,2]`, pushing `is_word` to `[3,2]` and `you_word` to `[4,2]`

3. **Move Baba to bring `keke_word` down to form the rule**:
   - `up` to `[2,3]`
   - `up` to `[2,4]`
   - `down` to `[2,3]`, pushing `keke_word` to `[2,3]`
   - `down` to `[2,2]`, pushing `keke_word` to `[2,2]`
   - `right` to `[3,2]`, pushing `keke_word` to `[3,2]`

   At this point, the rule `KEKE IS YOU` is formed with `keke_word` at `[3,2]`, `is_word` at `[4,2]`, and `you_word` at `[5,2]`. Control shifts from `baba_obj` to `keke_obj`.

4. **Move Keke Right thrice to reach the flag**:
   - `right` from `[3,7]` to `[4,7]`
   - `right` to `[5,7]`
   - `right` to `[6,7]`, where `keke_obj` overlaps with `flag_obj`

Since the rule `FLAG IS WIN` is already formed horizontally at the bottom (`flag_word` at `[6,1]`, `is_word` at `[7,1]`, and `win_word` at `[8,1]`), reaching the flag results in winning the level.
