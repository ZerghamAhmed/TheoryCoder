```Python

Explanation:

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it caused the loss of control over Baba by breaking the existing "BABA IS YOU" rule before establishing the new "KEKE IS YOU" rule. Specifically, moving Baba to position [2,2] pushed the "is_word" from [2,2] to [2,1], disrupting the "BABA IS YOU" rule and resulting in the game being lost since there were no controllable characters left.

In the corrected action sequence, we ensure that we do not break the "BABA IS YOU" rule until after the "KEKE IS YOU" rule is formed. Here is the step-by-step breakdown:

1. **["left", "left", "left"]**: Move Baba from [6,4] to [3,4], positioning Baba next to the "keke_word".
2. **"up"**: Push the "keke_word" from [3,4] to [3,5]. This sets up the vertical column needed for "KEKE IS YOU".
3. **"down"**: Move Baba back down to [3,4].
4. **["right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]**: Move Baba to [8,4], pushing the "is_word" at [8,4] leftwards to eventually bring it to [3,4].
5. **["left", "left", "left", "left"]**: Push the "is_word" from [7,4] to [3,4], aligning it under the "keke_word".
6. **["down", "down", "left"]**: Move Baba to the "you_word" at [3,2] without disrupting the existing rules.
7. **"up"**: Push the "you_word" from [3,2] to [3,3], completing the "KEKE IS YOU" rule vertically at [3,3] to [3,5].
8. **["right", "right", "right"]**: Now controlling Keke, move from [3,7] to [6,7], where the "flag_obj" is located, achieving the game's win condition.

By carefully rearranging the words to form the new rule without breaking the existing one prematurely, and then moving the new controllable character to the goal, we successfully win the level.
