Explanation:

In our previous action sequence, we unintentionally moved the 'is_word' at [2,2], which is a part of the 'BABA IS YOU' rule. This rule defines 'baba_obj' as the controllable character. By moving 'is_word' from [2,2], we broke the 'BABA IS YOU' rule before forming the 'KEKE IS YOU' rule, resulting in the loss of control over 'baba_obj' and ultimately losing the game.

To correct this, we need to avoid moving the 'is_word' at [2,2]. Instead, we can use the 'is_word' at [7,1] to form the 'KEKE IS YOU' rule. Here's how the corrected action sequence works:

1. **Move left three times**: Position 'baba_obj' near 'keke_word' at [3,4].
2. **Move down**: Align with 'keke_word'.
3. **Move left**: Push 'keke_word' left to [2,4].
4. **Move down**: Position below 'keke_word'.
5. **Move right twice**: Navigate to the 'is_word' at [7,1].
6. **Move right**: Reach 'is_word' at [7,1].
7. **Move up twice**: Push 'is_word' up to [7,3].
8. **Move left, down, down**: Bring 'is_word' to align with 'keke_word' at [2,4].
9. **Move right twice**: Push 'is_word' left to form 'KEKE IS YOU'.

By forming 'KEKE IS YOU' without disturbing 'BABA IS YOU', we maintain control over 'baba_obj' until we can control 'keke_obj'. After the rule is formed, 'keke_obj' becomes controllable, and we can move it to the 'flag_obj' to win the level.
