```Python
["right", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

To win the level, we need to follow the high-level plan provided:

1. **Break the rule `rock is rock`**: This will allow the formation of the new rule `rock is flag`, causing all rocks to turn into flags.
2. **Move Baba (our controllable character) to the flag object**: Since `flag is win` is an active rule, touching the flag will win the level.

**Detailed Steps:**

1. **Break the rule `rock is rock`**:
   - The rule `rock is rock` is formed by the words at positions `[2,3]` (`rock_word`), `[3,3]` (`is_word`), and `[4,3]` (`rock_word`).
   - We can break this rule by moving the `is_word` at `[3,3]` down to `[3,2]`.

2. **Movement Actions to Break the Rule**:
   - **From Baba's starting position `[2,5]`**:
     - `right` to `[3,5]`.
     - `down` to `[3,4]`.
     - `down` to `[3,3]`. This pushes the `is_word` down to `[3,2]`, breaking the `rock is rock` rule.

3. **Form the rule `rock is flag`**:
   - With the `rock is rock` rule broken, the rule `rock is flag` at positions `[6,1]` (`rock_word`), `[7,1]` (`is_word`), `[8,1]` (`flag_word`) becomes active.
   - All `rock_obj` instances transform into `flag_obj` instances. In this case, the rock at `[7,5]` becomes a flag.

4. **Move Baba to the Flag**:
   - From Baba's position `[3,3]`:
     - `right` to `[4,3]`.
     - `right` to `[5,3]`.
     - `right` to `[6,3]`.
     - `right` to `[7,3]`.
     - `up` to `[7,4]`.
     - `up` to `[7,5]`. Baba reaches the flag.

5. **Win the Game**:
   - Since `flag is win` is active, reaching the flag at `[7,5]` wins the level.

**Final Action Sequence**:

1. `right` (Move from `[2,5]` to `[3,5]`).
2. `down` (Move to `[3,4]`).
3. `down` (Move to `[3,3]`, pushing `is_word` down).
4. `right` (Move to `[4,3]`).
5. `right` (Move to `[5,3]`).
6. `right` (Move to `[6,3]`).
7. `right` (Move to `[7,3]`).
8. `up` (Move to `[7,4]`).
9. `up` (Move to `[7,5]`, reaching the flag).
