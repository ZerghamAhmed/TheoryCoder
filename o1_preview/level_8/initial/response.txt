```Python
["left", "left", "left", "up", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

To win the level, we need to break the "Wall Is Stop" rule and then move Baba to the flag. Here's how the action sequence achieves this:

1. **Move Left x3:** From the initial position `[5,4]`, moving left three times (`["left", "left", "left"]`) takes Baba to `[2,4]`. The third left move pushes the `is_word` from `[2,4]` to `[1,4]`, breaking the "Wall Is Stop" rule.

2. **Move Up:** Moving up (`"up"`) to `[2,5]` positions Baba closer to the path towards the flag.

3. **Move Right x3:** Moving right three times (`["right", "right", "right"]`) moves Baba through positions `[3,5]`, `[4,5]`, and `[5,5]`.

4. **Move Up x3:** Finally, moving up three times (`["up", "up", "up"]`) takes Baba through `[5,6]` (the wall, which is now passable), `[5,7]`, and `[5,8]` where the flag is located.

By following this sequence, Baba reaches the flag and wins the level.
