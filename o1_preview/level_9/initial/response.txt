To achieve the goal of winning the level, we need to execute the high-level plan provided. The plan consists of two main actions:

1. **Break the rule `skull is kill`**: This will allow Baba to pass through the skulls without losing the game.
2. **Move Baba to the flag**: Once the rule is broken, Baba can reach the flag to win the level.

Here's how we can accomplish this with low-level actions:

1. **Break the rule `skull is kill`**:
   - Move **up** from `(2,5)` to `(2,6)`.
   - Move **up** again to `(2,7)`, pushing the `is_word` from `(2,7)` to `(2,8)`. This breaks the rule by separating the words.

2. **Move Baba to the flag**:
   - Move **right** to `(3,7)`, pushing the `kill_word` from `(3,7)` to `(4,7)`.
   - Move **down** to `(3,6)`.
   - Move **down** again to `(3,5)`.
   - Move **right** to `(4,5)`.
   - Move **right** to `(5,5)`. Since `skull is kill` is broken, skulls are no longer deadly or obstructive.
   - Move **right** to `(6,5)`, reaching the flag and winning the level.
