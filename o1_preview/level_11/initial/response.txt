To achieve the high-level plan and win the level, we need to:

1. Move Baba from its initial position (2,6) to reach and push rock_obj_2 at (8,3) north into the goop at (8,4), which will remove both the rock and the goop.
2. Then, maneuver Baba to get behind rock_obj_1 at (7,3) and push it east to (8,3).
3. Push rock_obj_1 north to (8,5) through (8,4), sinking it into the goop at (8,5) and clearing the path.
4. Finally, move Baba to the flag at (7,7) to win the game.

Here is the sequence of actions to accomplish this:

```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "right",
 "right", "right", "up", "down", "left", "left", "up", "right", 
 "down", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "left", "up"]
```
