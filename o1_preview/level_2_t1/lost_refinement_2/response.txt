```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it did not correctly align the `win_word` and `is_word` to form the necessary rule "BABA IS WIN" at the specific coordinates given in the high-level plan. Additionally, the sequence may have attempted to move `baba_obj` into occupied spaces or failed to consider the positions of obstacles and other words, which prevented the formation of the required rule and possibly broke the existing "BABA IS YOU" rule, leading to a loss.

In the corrected action sequence, we carefully navigate `baba_obj` to push the `win_word` and `is_word` into the required positions without disrupting existing crucial rules:

1. **Move Down (`"down"`):** From the starting position `[5,4]`, move down to `[5,3]`. This positions us to the left of the path towards the `win_word`.

2. **Move Left x3 (`"left", "left", "left"`):** Progress left to `[4,3]`, `[3,3]`, and `[2,3]` to align below the `win_word` at `[2,4]`.

3. **Move Up (`"up"`):** Push the `win_word` up from `[2,4]` to `[2,5]`, which in turn pushes the `is_word` from `[2,5]` to `[2,6]`. This action does not disrupt any existing rules.

4. **Move Left (`"left"`):** Move to `[1,4]` to get to the left side of the `win_word`.

5. **Move Up (`"up"`):** Move up to `[1,5]` to align with where we want to push the `win_word`.

6. **Move Right x2 (`"right", "right"`):** Push the `win_word` right from `[2,5]` to `[4,5]`, moving through `[3,5]`. The `win_word` is now at the correct position `[4,5]` as per the high-level plan.

7. **Move Left (`"left"`):** Move back to `[3,5]` to prepare for pushing the `is_word`.

8. **Move Up (`"up"`):** Move up to `[3,6]` to align with the `is_word` now at `[2,6]`.

9. **Move Left (`"left"`):** Move to `[2,6]`, to the left of the `is_word`.

10. **Move Right x2 (`"right", "right"`):** Push the `is_word` right from `[2,6]` to `[4,6]`, moving through `[3,6]`. The `is_word` is now at `[4,6]`.

By following these steps, we have successfully formed the vertical rule "BABA IS WIN" with:
- `baba_word` at `[4,7]`
- `is_word` at `[4,6]`
- `win_word` at `[4,5]`

We ensured that the existing rule "BABA IS YOU" remained intact (with `baba_word` at `[4,7]`, `is_word` at `[5,7]`, and `you_word` at `[6,7]`), so we still have control over `baba_obj`.

Since `baba_obj` is now both `YOU` and `WIN`, we immediately win the game upon forming the rule "BABA IS WIN".
