**Explanation:**

To execute the high-level plan `['push_to win_word_1 [4,5]', 'push_to is_word_1 [4,6]']`, the low-level action sequence moves Baba to push the words to the specified positions. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Move towards 'win_word' to push it to [4,5]:**

   - **Actions 1-6:** Move Baba from [5,4] to [1,4] by navigating around 'win_word' and obstacles.
     - `left` x2 to [3,4]
     - `down` to [3,3]
     - `left` x2 to [1,3]
     - `up` to [1,4]
   - **Actions 7-8:** Push 'win_word' from [2,4] to [4,4] by moving right twice.
     - `right` x2
   - **Actions 9-11:** Position Baba to push 'win_word' upwards to [4,5].
     - `down` to [3,3]
     - `right` to [4,3]
     - `up` to push 'win_word' to [4,5]

2. **Move towards 'is_word' to push it to [4,6]:**

   - **Actions 12-14:** Navigate Baba to position behind 'is_word' at [2,5].
     - `left` x2 to [2,3]
     - `up` to [2,4]
   - **Action 15:** Push 'is_word' upwards from [2,5] to [2,6].
     - `up`
   - **Actions 16-17:** Move Baba around to get behind 'is_word' for horizontal pushing.
     - `left` to [1,5]
     - `up` to [1,6]
   - **Actions 18-19:** Push 'is_word' right to [4,6].
     - `right` x2

By following this sequence, Baba successfully pushes 'win_word' and 'is_word' to their target positions, forming the rule that allows winning the level.
