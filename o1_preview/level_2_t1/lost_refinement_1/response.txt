```Python

["left", "left", "down", "left", "left", "up", "right", "right", "down", "right", "up", "left", "left", "up", "up", "left", "up", "right", "right"]

```

explanation:

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it broke the "BABA IS YOU" rule before establishing the "BABA IS WIN" rule. This made the player lose control of Baba and lose the game. The corrected action sequence avoids breaking the "BABA IS YOU" rule prematurely and ensures that the "BABA IS WIN" rule is formed before any essential rules are disrupted. By carefully moving the words without breaking existing rules, we successfully form "BABA IS WIN" and win the level.
