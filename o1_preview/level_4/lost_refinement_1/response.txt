```Python
["down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "down", "right", "down", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not result in winning the game because forming the rule **"Rock Is Flag"** was insufficient without an active **"Flag Is Win"** rule. Without **"Flag Is Win"**, touching the flag object does not lead to victory.

To correct this, we modified the action sequence to form the rule **"Rock Is Win"** instead. By pushing the **"Rock"** word to align with the **"Is"** and **"Win"** words, we create the rule **"Rock Is Win"**. This turns the rock object into a win condition. Finally, we move Baba to the rock object to win the game.

**Steps in the Corrected Action Sequence:**

1. **down**: Baba moves from `[2,5]` to `[2,4]`.
2. **down**: Baba moves to `[2,3]`.
3. **right**: Baba moves to `[3,3]`.
4. **right**: Baba moves to `[4,3]` (next to the **"Rock"** word).
5. **right**: Push the **"Rock"** word from `[4,3]` to `[5,3]`.
6. **up**: Push the **"Rock"** word up to `[5,4]`.
7. **up**: Continue pushing to `[5,5]`.
8. **up**: Continue pushing to `[5,6]`.
9. **up**: Continue pushing to `[5,7]`.
10. **up**: Push the **"Rock"** word to `[5,8]`.
11. **right**: Push the **"Rock"** word to `[6,8]`, aligning it with **"Is"** at `[7,8]` and **"Win"** at `[8,8]` to form **"Rock Is Win"**.
12. **down**: Baba moves to `[6,7]`.
13. **right**: Baba moves to `[7,7]`.
14. **down**: Baba moves to `[7,6]`.
15. **down**: Baba moves to `[7,5]` (location of the **rock object** which is now the win condition).

By following this action sequence, Baba touches the rock object (now a win condition), and the game is won.
