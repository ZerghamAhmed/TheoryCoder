```Python
['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right']
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not result in winning the game because it moved the `rock_word` **downwards** instead of **upwards**. By pushing the `rock_word` down, we moved it away from the `is_word` and `flag_word`, preventing the formation of the rule `ROCK IS FLAG`. Without forming this rule, the `rock_obj` does not transform into a `flag_obj`, and therefore, we cannot complete the high-level plan which requires moving `baba_obj` to the `flag_obj`.

In the corrected action sequence, we:

1. **Move Right Twice**: Position Baba next to the `rock_word`.
2. **Move Down Twice**: Align Baba with the `rock_word` at position `[4, 3]`.
3. **Move Up Five Times**: Push the `rock_word` upwards to align with the `is_word` at `[2, 8]` and the `flag_word` at `[6, 8]`. This forms the rule `ROCK IS FLAG`.
4. **Move Down Three Times**: Bring Baba back down to a position where we can navigate towards the new `flag_obj`.
5. **Move Right Three Times**: Move Baba towards the position of the transformed `flag_obj` at `[7, 5]`.

By forming the rule `ROCK IS FLAG`, all `rock_obj` instances transform into `flag_obj` instances. Moving Baba to the `flag_obj` completes the high-level plan and results in winning the level.
