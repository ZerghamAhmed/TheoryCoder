**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it failed to correctly form the rule **"ROCK IS FLAG"**. While it moved the `rock_word`, it did not properly align the `rock_word`, `is_word`, and `flag_word` tiles to create the rule. Without forming this rule, the rock object remains unchanged, and the second high-level action of moving Baba to the flag cannot be completed since the flag object does not exist yet.

In the corrected action sequence, the actions are adjusted to ensure that:

1. **Forming "ROCK IS FLAG":**
   - Baba moves to push the `rock_word` from its initial position at `[4, 3]` to align with an `is_word` and a `flag_word`.
   - The `rock_word` is pushed right and down to meet the `is_word` at `[7, 1]` and the `flag_word` at `[8, 1]`, forming the rule.
   
2. **Moving to the New Flag:**
   - After forming the rule, the rock object transforms into a flag object.
   - Baba moves towards the new flag object to complete the level.

This sequence aligns the words correctly to form the necessary rule and allows Baba to reach the flag, resulting in winning the game.
