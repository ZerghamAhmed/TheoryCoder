```Python
["right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "left", "up", "up", "up", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence didn't win the game because it failed to correctly form the rule `ROCK IS FLAG`. Without forming this rule, the rock objects on the map do not transform into flag objects. Since there are no flag objects in the initial state, and `FLAG IS WIN` is an active rule, it's necessary to create a flag object to win the game.

**Corrected Action Sequence:**

1. **Move Baba to the Rock Word:**
   - `right`, `right`, `down`, `down`: Baba moves from `[2,5]` to `[4,3]`, where the `rock_word` is located.

2. **Push the Rock Word Up to Form "ROCK IS FLAG":**
   - `down`: Baba moves to `[4,2]` to align below the `rock_word`.
   - `up`, `up`, `up`, `up`: Baba pushes the `rock_word` up from `[4,3]` to `[4,7]`.

3. **Form the Rule "ROCK IS FLAG":**
   - The `rock_word` is now aligned with the `is_word` at `[4,8]` and the `flag_word` at `[6,8]`. Since the `is_word` is at `[4,8]`, you need to push it right to `[5,8]` to complete the sequence.
   - `left`: Baba moves to `[3,7]`.
   - `up`: Baba moves to `[3,8]` and pushes the `is_word` right to `[4,8]`.

4. **Win the Game:**
   - The rule `ROCK IS FLAG` is now formed, transforming all rock objects into flag objects.
   - Baba can now touch any of the new flag objects to win the game. Since Baba is already near the location of the transformed `rock_obj`, no additional moves are needed.

By following this corrected action sequence, the `ROCK IS FLAG` rule is successfully formed, the rock objects become flag objects, and the player can win the game by moving onto a flag.
