To win the level, we need to form the rule **FLAG IS WIN** and then move Baba to the flag. Here's how we can achieve this:

1. **Form the rule "FLAG IS WIN":**
   - **Move Baba to the "flag_word":**
     - From Baba's starting position `[2, 4]`, move **right** 4 times to reach `[6, 4]`.
     - Move **up** once to `[6, 5]`, where the "flag_word" is located.
   - **Push the "flag_word" upwards:**
     - Move **up** 3 times to push the "flag_word" from `[6, 5]` to `[6, 8]`, aligning it with "is_word" at `[7, 8]` and "win_word" at `[8, 8]`. This forms the rule **FLAG IS WIN**.

2. **Move Baba to the "flag_obj":**
   - From `[6, 8]`, move **down** 4 times to `[6, 4]`.
   - Move **right** once to `[7, 4]`, where the "flag_obj" is located.
   - Since **FLAG IS WIN** is formed, touching the flag will win the level.

```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "down", "down", "down", "down", "right"]
```
