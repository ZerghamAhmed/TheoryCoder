```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "down", "down", "down", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the previous action sequence, we moved down **four times** after pushing the `flag_word` up to form the rule "FLAG IS WIN". This caused `baba_obj` (Baba) to move down to position **[6,3]**. When we then moved right, Baba was at position **[7,3]**, which is **below** the `flag_obj` at position **[7,4]**. Since Baba did not overlap with the flag, we did not win the game.

To correct this, we need to move down only **three times** instead of four after forming the rule. This adjustment places Baba at position **[6,4]**. When we then move right, Baba moves to **[7,4]**, directly overlapping with the `flag_obj`. 

Here's the corrected action sequence:

1. **"right", "right", "right", "right"** - Moves Baba from [2,4] to [6,4] to reach `flag_word`.
2. **"up", "up", "up"** - Pushes `flag_word` up from [6,5] to [6,8] to align with `is_word` and `win_word`, forming "FLAG IS WIN".
3. **"down", "down", "down"** - Moves Baba back down to [6,4], without breaking the formed rule.
4. **"right"** - Moves Baba to [7,4], overlapping with `flag_obj`.

By making this correction, Baba successfully reaches the flag while "FLAG IS WIN" is active, resulting in winning the game.
