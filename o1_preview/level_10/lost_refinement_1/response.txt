```Python
['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'right', 'up', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'up']
```

**Explanation:**

In the **previous action sequence**, we attempted to reach the flag without successfully breaking the "GOOP IS SINK" rule. Specifically, we tried to move upward into the goop tiles while the rule was still active, resulting in losing the game when Baba stepped on a goop tile.

**Why the previous sequence did not win the game:**

- The previous sequence did not correctly break the "GOOP IS SINK" rule. As a result, Baba could not safely traverse the goop tiles.
- When we moved **upward** into the goop area, Baba sank because the goop still had the sinking property.
- The actions after attempting to move through the goop were ineffective since the game was already lost.

**Corrected action sequence explanation:**

1. **Move Down (x4):** We move Baba down from position `[2,6]` to `[2,2]`, positioning him in line with the "GOOP" word.

2. **Move Right (x3):** Baba moves right to `[5,2]`, approaching the "GOOP" word located at `[6,2]`.

3. **Move Down:** Baba moves down to `[5,1]` to position himself below the "GOOP" word.

4. **Move Right:** Baba moves right to `[6,1]`, directly beneath the "GOOP" word at `[6,2]`.

5. **Push Up:** Baba moves up to `[6,2]`, pushing the "GOOP" word up to `[6,3]`. This action breaks the alignment of "GOOP IS SINK", effectively removing the sink property from the goop tiles.

6. **Move Right:** Baba moves right to `[7,2]`. There's an "IS" word here.

7. **Push Up:** Baba moves up to `[7,2]`, pushing the "IS" word up to `[7,3]`, clearing the path.

8. **Move Up (x5):** Baba moves up through positions `[7,3]` to `[7,7]`. Since "GOOP IS SINK" is broken, he can safely traverse the goop tiles at `[7,4]` and `[7,5]`.

9. **Reach the Flag:** Upon reaching `[7,7]`, where the flag is located, Baba wins the game because "FLAG IS WIN" is an active rule.

**Key Points:**

- **Breaking the "GOOP IS SINK" Rule:** By pushing the "GOOP" word out of alignment, we deactivate the sinking property of the goop tiles.

- **Safe Passage:** With the rule broken, Baba can safely move through the goop tiles without sinking.

- **Winning Condition:** Reaching the flag while "FLAG IS WIN" is active allows Baba to win the level.

**Conclusion:**

This corrected action sequence aligns with the high-level plan provided by the PDDL planner:

- **`break_rule goop_word_1 is_word_3 sink_word_1`:** We break the "GOOP IS SINK" rule.
- **`move_to baba_obj_1 flag_obj_1`:** We move Baba to the flag.

By executing these actions, we successfully navigate the level and win the game.
