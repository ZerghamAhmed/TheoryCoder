```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right", "break_rule", "left", "up", "up", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the previous action sequence, we attempted to break the "goop is sink" rule by pushing the `goop_word` upward. However, this resulted in unintentionally reforming the rule vertically, so "goop is sink" remained active. Consequently, when we tried to move towards the `flag_obj`, the `goop_obj` tiles still acted as sink tiles, preventing us from reaching the flag and winning the game.

To correct this, we need to break the "goop is sink" rule without accidentally reforming it. Here's how the corrected action sequence achieves this:

1. **Move Down x4:** We move `baba_obj` from `[2,6]` to `[2,2]`.
2. **Move Right x3:** We move to `[5,2]` (adjacent to `goop_word` at `[6,2]`).
3. **Break Rule:** We simulate pushing `goop_word` left from `[6,2]` to `[5,2]`, breaking "goop is sink" without forming any unintended rules.
4. **Move Left:** We move `baba_obj` back to `[5,2]`.
5. **Move Up x4:** We navigate upwards, avoiding `goop_obj` obstacles now that they no longer sink us.
6. **Move Right x4:** We move towards the `flag_obj` at `[7,7]`.
7. **Move Down x4:** We reach the `flag_obj`, and since "flag is win" is active, we win the game.

By breaking the "goop is sink" rule correctly and navigating around obstacles, we can reach the flag and win the level.
