```Python
["left", "left", "down", "left", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "up", "right", "down", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not result in winning the game because it involved pushing the 'win_word' and 'is_word' to the **left**, moving them away from their target positions specified in the high-level plan. Specifically, pushing 'win_word' from `[2,4]` to `[1,4]` and 'is_word' from `[2,5]` to `[1,5]` moved these words further from the positions `[4,5]` and `[4,6]` where they need to be to form the rule "BABA IS WIN" vertically with 'baba_word' at `[4,7]`.

In the corrected action sequence provided, we avoid pushing 'win_word' and 'is_word' to the left. Instead, we:

1. Move Baba to a position where he can push 'win_word' **upwards** and then **right** towards `[4,5]`.
2. Similarly, move 'is_word' upwards or keep it in place and push it **right** towards `[4,6]`.
3. Ensure that 'win_word' and 'is_word' are aligned vertically under 'baba_word', forming "BABA IS WIN".

Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **"left", "left"**: Move Baba from `[5,4]` to `[3,4]`.
2. **"down"**: Move down to `[3,3]` to navigate around 'win_word'.
3. **"left"**: Move to `[2,3]` to approach 'win_word' from below.
4. **"up", "up"**: Push 'win_word' up from `[2,4]` to `[2,5]`, then to `[2,6]`.
5. **"right", "right", "right"**: Push 'win_word' right to `[3,6]`, `[4,6]`, aligning it with 'baba_word'.
6. **"up"**: Move up to align with 'is_word' if necessary.
7. **"right"**: Push 'is_word' right towards `[4,6]`.
8. **"down", "down"**: Return Baba to a safe position or finalize positioning.

By following this action sequence, we effectively reposition the words to form the required rule without moving them away from their target positions, enabling us to win the level.
