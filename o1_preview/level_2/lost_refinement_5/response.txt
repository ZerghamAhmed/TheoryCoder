**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not result in winning the game because it failed to correctly position the `is_word` and `win_word` to form the rule "BABA IS WIN". Specifically, it did not successfully move the `is_word` to the required position `[4,6]` to complete the rule.

In the corrected action sequence, the steps are as follows:

1. **Move towards `win_word` and push it into position:**

   - `left`, `left`, `down`, `left`, `left`, `up`: Move `baba_obj` from `[5,4]` to `[1,4]` via `[4,4]`, `[3,4]`, `[3,3]`, `[2,3]`, `[1,3]`.
   - `right`, `right`: Push `win_word` from `[2,4]` to `[4,4]`.
   - `down`, `right`, `up`: Move `baba_obj` around to push `win_word` up to `[4,5]`.

2. **Move towards `is_word` and push it into position:**

   - `right`, `up`, `up`, `right`, `up`: Navigate to position `[5,7]` to interact with `is_word` at `[5,7]`.
   - `left`: Push `is_word` left to `[4,7]`, moving `baba_word` to `[3,7]`.
   - `down`, `left`: Push `is_word` down to `[4,6]`.
   - `up`: Push `baba_word` back to `[4,7]` to complete the rule.

By following this sequence, we successfully form the rule "BABA IS WIN" horizontally at positions `[4,7]` (`baba_word`), `[4,6]` (`is_word`), and `[4,5]` (`win_word`). This triggers the game win condition according to the game's logic.
