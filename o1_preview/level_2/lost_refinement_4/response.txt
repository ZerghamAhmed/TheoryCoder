```Python
["left", "left", "up", "left", "right", "right", "up", "down", "down", "left", "left", "right", "right", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the previous action sequence, the key issue was that the `is_word` and `win_word` were not correctly positioned to form the rule **"baba is win"** vertically beneath the `baba_word`. Without this rule, the game does not recognize that `baba_obj` can win upon overlapping with a `win` object. 

Here's the step-by-step rationale for the corrected action sequence:

1. **Move towards `is_word`:**
   - **"left"**: Move from `[5,4]` to `[4,4]`.
   - **"left"**: Move to `[3,4]`.
   - **"up"**: Move to `[3,5]`.
   - **"left"**: Move to `[2,5]` (pushes `is_word` from `[2,5]` to `[3,5]`).

2. **Position `is_word` under `baba_word`:**
   - **"right"**: Move to `[3,5]` (pushes `is_word` to `[4,5]`).
   - **"right"**: Move to `[4,5]` (pushes `is_word` to `[5,5]`).
   - **"up"**: Move to `[4,6]` (pushes `is_word` to `[4,6]`), aligning it vertically under `baba_word` at `[4,7]`.

3. **Retrieve and position `win_word`:**
   - **"down"**: Move to `[4,5]`.
   - **"down"**: Move to `[4,4]`.
   - **"left"**: Move to `[3,4]`.
   - **"left"**: Move to `[2,4]` (pushes `win_word` from `[2,4]` to `[3,4]`).
   - **"right"**: Move to `[3,4]` (pushes `win_word` to `[4,4]`).
   - **"right"**: Move to `[4,4]` (pushes `win_word` to `[5,4]`).
   - **"up"**: Move to `[4,5]` (pushes `win_word` to `[4,5]`), completing the vertical alignment.

By executing these actions, we successfully form the rule **"baba is win"** vertically at positions `[4,7]`, `[4,6]`, and `[4,5]`. Once this rule is established, the game recognizes that the `baba_obj` has the "win" property. This means that `baba_obj` immediately wins the game upon forming this rule, satisfying the level's objective.

**Why the Previous Action Sequence Did Not Win the Game:**

The previous action sequence failed to correctly align the `is_word` and `win_word` under the `baba_word`. Specifically, there were unnecessary and incorrect movements that led to the misplacement of these words:

- The sequence involved extra moves that didn't contribute to forming the required rule.
- Pushing the `win_word` and `is_word` without proper coordination led to them being in incorrect positions.
- The `win_word` might have been pushed too far or not elevated to the correct row, preventing the formation of the rule.

Without forming **"baba is win"**, the game does not grant the winning condition to `baba_obj`, and thus, the level cannot be completed.
