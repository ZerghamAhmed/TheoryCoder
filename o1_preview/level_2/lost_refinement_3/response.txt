Explanation:

The previous action sequence did not result in winning the level because it did not correctly position the `win_word` and `is_word` tiles to form the rule "Baba Is Win". In that sequence, both words were pushed upwards, which did not align them with the `baba_word` at the necessary positions to form the rule vertically.

In the corrected action sequence, we focus on pushing the `win_word` and `is_word` to the right positions to form the rule "Baba Is Win" vertically. Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. **Move left** twice and **down** once to reach the left side of `win_word`.
2. **Move left** twice more and **up** once to get into position to push `win_word` to the right.
3. **Move right** twice to push `win_word` from `[2,4]` to `[4,4]`.
4. **Move up** and **right** to push `win_word` up to `[4,5]`.
5. **Move down** twice to return to a lower position.
6. **Move left** twice and **up** twice to get below the `is_word`.
7. **Move down** and **left**, then **up** twice to get to the left of `is_word`.
8. **Move right** twice to push `is_word` from `[2,5]` to `[4,6]`.

By aligning `baba_word` at `[4,7]`, `is_word` at `[4,6]`, and `win_word` at `[4,5]`, we form the rule "Baba Is Win", which causes the game to be won when Baba interacts with it.
