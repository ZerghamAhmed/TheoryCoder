**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it broke the "BABA IS YOU" rule before forming the "BABA IS WIN" rule, causing the player to lose control of Baba and resulting in a loss. The sequence pushed the "win_word" and "you_word" into positions that disrupted the existing rule "BABA IS YOU".

In the corrected action sequence, we carefully move the "win_word" and "is_word" into the positions [4,5] and [4,6] respectively, to form the vertical "BABA IS WIN" without breaking the "BABA IS YOU" rule until the winning condition is achieved. This sequence ensures that "BABA IS YOU" remains intact while we form "BABA IS WIN", allowing us to win the game before losing control of Baba.

**Step-by-step actions:**

1. `left` x3: Move Baba from [5,4] to [2,4], where the "win_word" is located.
2. `right` x2: Push "win_word" from [2,4] to [4,4].
3. `up`: Push "win_word" from [4,4] to [4,5], placing it at the required position.
4. `down`: Move Baba back to [4,4].
5. `left`: Move to [3,4].
6. `up`: Move to [3,5].
7. `left`: Move to [2,5], where "is_word_1" is located.
8. `up`: Push "is_word_1" from [2,5] to [2,6].
9. `right` x3: Push "is_word_1" from [2,6] to [4,6], aligning it under "baba_word" at [4,7].

This action sequence successfully forms "BABA IS WIN" vertically at positions [4,7], [4,6], [4,5] without disrupting the "BABA IS YOU" rule until the end, allowing the player to win the level.
