You are an AI agent that must come up with a model of the game you are playing. This model you are making of the game
will be a python program that captures the logic and mechanics of the game. There has been an execution error in your world model.

You need to carry out an exploratory goal that will help you understand what your model is missing.

You are given the following suggestion for exploratory plans. Which one of this is the most likely one that you should carry out?

Think about the current state of the game and the current world model you have. Also include an explanation.

Notes:

Think about what types of interactions are missing in your world model. For example, try colliding into different objects
or try pushing other objects into others. Think deeply about which of these interactions you have not seen before.

SUGGESTED EXPLORATORY PLANS: 

['push_to baba_obj rock_obj flag_obj', 'move_to baba_obj goop_obj', 'push_to baba_obj rock_obj goop_obj', 'move_to baba_obj flag_obj', 'move_to baba_obj rock_obj']
