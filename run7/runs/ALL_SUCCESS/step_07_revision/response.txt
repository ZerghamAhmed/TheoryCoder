The main issue in the current world model pertains to handling the "sink" condition involving `goop_obj`. The error message indicates that the `goop_obj` at position `[8, 4]` was expected to be removed after the `baba_obj` moved over it, due to the `goop_word is_word sink_word` rule. The current logic doesn't account for this specific scenario where `baba_obj` moving onto `goop_obj` should also remove the `goop_obj`. I'll adjust the transition model to handle this case correctly.

Let's update the code accordingly:

```Python
# make sure to include these import statements
from copy import deepcopy
from utils import directions

def manage_rule_changes(state):
    # Check if 'rock_word is_word flag_word' rule is formed
    if 'rock_word is_word flag_word' in state['rules_formed']:
        # Convert rock_obj to flag_obj and manage overlappables
        if 'flag_obj' not in state:
            state['flag_obj'] = []
        state['flag_obj'].extend(state.get('rock_obj', []))
        state.pop('rock_obj', None)
        
        # Mark flag_obj as overlappable
        state['overlappables'].append('flag_obj')

def transition_model(state, action):
    # Create a deepcopy of the state to avoid modifying the original state directly
    new_state = deepcopy(state)
    
    # Get the action direction vector
    direction = directions[action]
    
    # Iterate over all controllable objects and attempt to move them
    for controllable in state['controllables']:
        # Get the current position of the controllable object
        current_position = state[controllable][0]
        
        # Calculate the new position after the action
        new_position = [current_position[0] + direction[0], current_position[1] + direction[1]]
        
        # Check if the new position is within the borders
        if new_position in state['border']:
            continue
        
        # Check if the new position contains a pushable object
        can_move = True
        for pushable in state['pushables']:
            if new_position in state[pushable]:
                # Try to push the pushable object
                if not push_pushable(state, new_state, pushable, new_position, direction):
                    can_move = False
                    break
        
        # If the move is valid, update the position of the controllable
        if can_move:
            new_state[controllable][0] = new_position

            # Check for sinking condition with goop_obj
            if 'goop_word is_word sink_word' in state['rules_formed']:
                if new_position in state['goop_obj']:
                    # Remove the controllable from new_state
                    new_state[controllable].remove(new_position)
                    # Since baba_obj is removed, remove it from controllables
                    new_state['controllables'].remove(controllable)
                    # Remove the goop_obj at the sinking position
                    new_state['goop_obj'].remove(new_position)

    # Additional logic to handle rock_obj sinking into goop_obj
    if 'goop_word is_word sink_word' in state['rules_formed']:
        for rock_position in new_state.get('rock_obj', []):
            if rock_position in state['goop_obj']:
                new_state['rock_obj'].remove(rock_position)

    # Manage rule changes after movements
    manage_rule_changes(new_state)
    
    # If no controllables are left, mark the game as lost
    if not new_state['controllables']:
        new_state['lost'] = True
    
    return new_state

def push_pushable(state, new_state, pushable, position, direction):
    # Calculate the new position of the pushable object
    next_position = [position[0] + direction[0], position[1] + direction[1]]
    
    # Check if next position is within the borders
    if next_position in state['border']:
        return False
    
    # Check if the next position has another pushable object
    for other_pushable in state['pushables']:
        if next_position in state[other_pushable]:
            # Recursively try to push the next pushable
            if not push_pushable(state, new_state, other_pushable, next_position, direction):
                return False
    
    # If the next position is valid, move the pushable
    for pushable in state['pushables']:
        if position in state[pushable]:
            new_state[pushable].remove(position)
            new_state[pushable].append(next_position)
    
    return True
```

This updated code will correctly handle the scenario where `baba_obj` moving onto a `goop_obj` results in both being removed due to the "sink" condition. This should fix the error you encountered with the `goop_obj` not being removed as expected.
