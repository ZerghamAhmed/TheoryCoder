To determine which exploratory plan to carry out, let's consider the current state of the game and the current world model, particularly focusing on interactions that have not been observed yet.

### Current State Analysis

1. **Entities on the Board:**
   - Controllable: `baba_obj` at [2, 6]
   - Pushable: `rock_obj` at [7, 3] and [8, 3]
   - Goal: `flag_obj` at [7, 7]
   - Obstacle: `goop_obj` at multiple positions
   - Rules: The model mentions a rule about `goop_word is_word sink_word`, but no current rule is formed based on the state.

2. **Current Model Behavior:**
   - Handles movement and pushing logic for controllables and pushables.
   - Checks for interactions with sinks (`goop_obj` with `sink_word` rule).
   - Transforms entities based on specific rules (e.g., `rock_word is_word flag_word`).

### Missing Interactions

Given the state and model, it seems the interactions involving different combinations of objects are not fully explored. Specifically, the interaction between `baba_obj` and `goop_obj` has not been tested without the sink rule being mentioned as active.

### Suggested Exploratory Plans

- **`move_to baba_obj rock_obj`:** Tests basic movement towards a pushable object.
- **`push_to baba_obj rock_obj flag_obj`:** Tests pushing a rock into a flag.
- **`push_to baba_obj rock_obj goop_obj`:** Tests pushing a rock into a goop.
- **`move_to baba_obj flag_obj`:** Tests movement towards the win condition.
- **`move_to baba_obj goop_obj`:** Tests interaction with goop without a sink rule.

### Plan Selection

The most insightful action, given the current state and model, is likely:

```Python
[move_to baba_obj goop_obj]
```

### Explanation

- **Unexplored Interaction:** The current model has logic for handling sinks if a rule is formed, but it does not explicitly account for what happens when `baba_obj` interacts with `goop_obj` without a sink rule.
- **Potential Model Gap:** This move tests if `goop_obj` has any inherent properties that affect `baba_obj`, such as acting as an immovable obstacle or causing a loss, independent of the sink rule.
- **Rule Verification:** Since no rule is currently formed, this interaction helps verify if the current model's assumption about the necessity of rules for interactions holds true.

This plan tests the model's assumptions and can uncover missing logic regarding interactions with `goop_obj`.
