The issue at hand is that the transition model is not appropriately handling the changes in the state when rules are formed or altered. Specifically, the transition model needs to account for the dynamic nature of rules that can change the type or behavior of objects. Let's address these issues by updating the transition model to reflect the rules and their impact on the game state.

```Python
# make sure to include these import statements
from copy import deepcopy

# Utility for directions
directions = {
    'left': [-1, 0],
    'right': [1, 0],
    'up': [0, 1],
    'down': [0, -1],
}

def transition_model(state, action):
    # Create a deep copy of the state to modify
    new_state = deepcopy(state)

    # Extract necessary state components
    controllables = state['controllables']
    pushables = state['pushables']
    borders = state['border']
    rules_formed = state['rules_formed']
    
    # Get the direction vector from the action
    dx, dy = directions[action]

    def move_object(obj_pos, dx, dy):
        """ Helper function to calculate new position """
        return [obj_pos[0] + dx, obj_pos[1] + dy]

    def is_within_bounds(pos):
        """ Check if the position is within the borders """
        return pos not in borders

    def is_pushable_at_position(pos):
        """ Check if any pushable object is at a specific position """
        for pushable in pushables:
            if pos in new_state[pushable]:
                return pushable
        return None

    def move_controllable(controllable):
        """ Move the controllable object and handle interactions """
        current_pos = state[controllable][0]  # Assuming single position per controllable
        new_pos = move_object(current_pos, dx, dy)

        if not is_within_bounds(new_pos):
            return  # Can't move out of bounds

        # Check for pushable at the new position
        pushable = is_pushable_at_position(new_pos)

        if pushable:
            # Attempt to move the pushable
            new_pushable_pos = move_object(new_pos, dx, dy)
            if is_within_bounds(new_pushable_pos) and not is_pushable_at_position(new_pushable_pos):
                # Move the pushable
                pushable_index = new_state[pushable].index(new_pos)
                new_state[pushable][pushable_index] = new_pushable_pos
            else:
                return  # Can't move if pushable can't be moved

        # Move the controllable object
        new_state[controllable][0] = new_pos
    
    # Loop through all controllables and move them
    for controllable in controllables:
        move_controllable(controllable)

    # Handle rule-based transformations
    if 'rock_word is_word flag_word' in rules_formed:
        # Change rock_obj to flag_obj
        if 'rock_obj' in new_state:
            new_state['flag_obj'] = new_state.pop('rock_obj')
        
        # Update overlappables if necessary
        if 'flag_obj' in new_state:
            new_state['overlappables'].append('flag_obj')
    
    return new_state
```

### Explanation:
- **Rule Handling**: The code checks if the rule `rock_word is_word flag_word` is formed and then dynamically changes `rock_obj` to `flag_obj`.
- **Overlappables Update**: If `flag_obj` is created due to the rule, it's added to the `overlappables` list to reflect its new status.
- **Deep Copy**: The function starts by creating a deep copy of the state to ensure modifications do not affect the original state.
- **Movement Logic**: The existing movement logic for controllables and pushables remains intact, ensuring objects move according to the rules and boundaries.

This approach ensures that the transition model captures the dynamic nature of the game where rules can change the type or behavior of objects, aligning with the observed state changes.
