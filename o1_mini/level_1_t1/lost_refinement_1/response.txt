```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence `['up', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'right']` failed to win the level because it primarily focused on moving the `baba_obj` upwards without correctly forming the necessary rule to achieve victory. Specifically, the actions did not arrange the `flag_word`, `is_word`, and `win_word` in a way that establishes the rule `flag is win`. As a result, the game did not recognize the win condition, and the `baba_obj` did not successfully reach the `flag_obj`.

The corrected action sequence starts by moving the `baba_obj` to the right four times to position it appropriately below the `flag_word`. This positioning allows the `baba_obj` to push the `flag_word` upwards, aligning it with the `is_word` and `win_word` to form the rule `flag is win`. After establishing the rule, the final move to the right ensures that `baba_obj` reaches the `flag_obj`, triggering the win condition.
