To achieve the high-level plan and win the level, the following sequence of actions should be taken:

1. **Form the Rule**: Align the `flag_word`, `is_word`, and `win_word` to create the rule `flag is win`. This involves moving the `is_word` to connect `flag_word` and `win_word`.

2. **Move to the Flag Object**: Once the rule is formed, navigate the controllable `baba_obj` to the `flag_obj` to trigger the win condition.

Here's the detailed action sequence to accomplish these steps:

```Python
["right", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right", "down", "down", "right", "up", "up", "left", "left", "down", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

- **Forming the Rule:**
  - Move **right** and **up** to position the `is_word` between `flag_word` and `win_word`.
  
- **Moving to Flag Object:**
  - Navigate **right** and **down** towards the `flag_obj`.
  - Ensure that `baba_obj` reaches the `flag_obj` to satisfy the win condition as per the newly formed rule.

This sequence ensures that the high-level plan is translated into actionable moves within the given action space to successfully win the level.
