```Python
["right", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right", "up", "left", "left", "down", "down", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence:
```Python
['right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'left', 'down', 'right']
```
did not win the game because it failed to correctly form the rule `flag is win`. Specifically, the sequence did not ensure that the `flag_word`, `is_word`, and `win_word` were aligned in the proper order to establish the win condition. As a result, even though Baba was moved around the grid, the game did not recognize a win state.

**Corrected Action Sequence Breakdown:**

1. **`right`, `right`**: Moves Baba towards the `flag_word` to begin forming the rule.
2. **`up`, `up`**: Aligns Baba vertically with the `is_word`.
3. **`right`, `right`**: Pushes the `flag_word` to the correct horizontal position relative to `is_word`.
4. **`up`**: Final adjustment to ensure the `win_word` aligns properly, completing the rule `flag is win`.
5. **`left`, `left`**: Moves Baba into position to trigger the win condition by overlapping with the `flag_obj`.
6. **`down`, `down`**: Final movements to ensure Baba fully overlaps with the `flag_obj`, activating the win state.
7. **`right`**: Confirms the win by completing the overlap.

By following this corrected sequence, the `form_rule` action successfully creates the `flag is win` rule, and subsequently, Baba reaches the `flag_obj`, resulting in a win.
