```Python

["left", "left", "forward", "forward"]

```

explanation:

We start at position [5,4] facing 'down' ([0, -1]). Our goal is to reach the red ball at position [5,6]. 

1. **First action**: `left` — This turns the agent from facing 'down' ([0, -1]) to facing 'right' ([1, 0]).
2. **Second action**: `left` — Now, the agent turns from facing 'right' ([1, 0]) to facing 'up' ([0, 1]).
3. **Third action**: `forward` — The agent moves from [5,4] to [5,5] while facing 'up'.
4. **Fourth action**: `forward` — The agent moves from [5,5] to [5,6], arriving at the location of the red ball.

By following these actions, we reach the red ball at [5,6] and achieve the goal of the level.
