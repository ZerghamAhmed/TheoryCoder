["left", "forward", "pickup", "left", "forward", "forward", "right", "forward", "toggle", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "right", "forward", "forward", "pickup"]
```

Explanation:

1. **left**: Turn left from facing down to facing right (east).
2. **forward**: Move forward to position [3,2], now adjacent to the red key at [4,2].
3. **pickup**: Pick up the red key while facing it.
4. **left**: Turn left to face up (north).
5. **forward**: Move forward to [3,3].
6. **forward**: Move forward to [3,4].
7. **right**: Turn right to face right (east).
8. **forward**: Move forward to [4,4], adjacent to the locked red door at [5,4].
9. **toggle**: Unlock and open the red door using the red key.
10. **forward**: Move forward to [5,4], passing through the opened door.
11. **forward**: Move forward to [6,4].
12. **forward**: Move forward to [7,4].
13. **forward**: Move forward to [8,4].
14. **forward**: Move forward to [9,4].
15. **right**: Turn right to face down (south).
16. **forward**: Move forward to [9,3].
17. **forward**: Move forward to [9,2], now adjacent to the red box at [9,1].
18. **pickup**: Pick up the red box, achieving the goal.

This sequence of actions allows the agent to navigate from its starting position to the red box while overcoming obstacles such as the locked red door. By picking up the red key first, the agent can unlock the door, proceed through it, and reach the red box to complete the level.
