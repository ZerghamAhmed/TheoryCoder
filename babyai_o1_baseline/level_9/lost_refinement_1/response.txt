Explanation:

In the previous attempt, the agent could not pick up the red box at the end because it was already carrying the red key, and the agent can only carry one item at a time. To correct this, we need to make space in the agent's inventory before trying to pick up the red box.

After opening the locked red door with the red key (using the 'toggle' action), we no longer need to carry the key. We added a 'drop' action after moving forward twice past the open door. This allows the agent to drop the red key safely without blocking the doorway (as per the domain rules). 

By dropping the key at this location, the agent's inventory is now empty, allowing it to pick up the red box later. We also added an additional 'forward' action to ensure the agent reaches the correct position before turning towards the red box.

With these adjustments, the agent can now successfully pick up the red box, achieving the goal and winning the level.
