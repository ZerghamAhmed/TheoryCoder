```

**Explanation:**

Starting from position `[11,13]` and facing up (north), the agent needs to reach the red key at `[12,8]` and then open the locked red door at `[7,8]`. 

1. **Turn Right**: The agent turns right to face east.
2. **Move Forward**: Moves to `[12,13]` facing east.
3. **Turn Right**: Turns right again to face south.
4. **Move Forward x4**: Moves forward four times to reach `[12,9]` facing south. This positions the agent one square above the red key at `[12,8]`.
5. **Pickup**: The agent picks up the red key since it's adjacent and facing towards it.
6. **Turn Right**: Turns right to face west.
7. **Move Forward x5**: Moves forward five times to reach `[7,9]` facing west.
8. **Turn Left**: Turns left to face south, positioning the agent adjacent to the locked red door at `[7,8]` and facing it.
9. **Toggle**: Toggles (opens) the locked red door using the red key in the inventory.

By following these actions, the agent successfully opens the door, achieving the goal for this level.
