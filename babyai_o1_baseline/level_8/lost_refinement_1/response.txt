```Python
["right", "forward", "right", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "pickup", "right", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "left", "forward", "right", "toggle", "forward"]
```

**Explanation:**

In the previous attempt, the agent tried to toggle the locked red door from the position [7,9] while facing south. However, this did not result in the door opening. This is likely because the door could not be toggled from that position or direction.

In the corrected action sequence, the agent approaches the door from a different position and faces it directly to ensure successful toggling. Here is the step-by-step explanation:

1. **"right"**: Turn right to face east ([1, 0]).
2. **"forward"**: Move to [12,13].
3. **"right"**: Turn right to face south ([0, -1]).
4. **"forward"**: Move to [12,12].
5. **"forward"**: Move to [12,11].
6. **"forward"**: Move to [12,10].
7. **"forward"**: Move to [12,9].
8. **"pickup"**: Pick up the red key at [12,8], which is directly in front.
9. **"right"**: Turn right to face west ([-1, 0]).
10. **"forward"**: Move to [11,9].
11. **"forward"**: Move to [10,9].
12. **"forward"**: Move to [9,9].
13. **"forward"**: Move to [8,9].
14. **"left"**: Turn left to face south ([0, -1]).
15. **"forward"**: Move to [8,8].
16. **"right"**: Turn right to face west ([-1, 0]).
17. **"toggle"**: Toggle (open) the locked red door at [7,8] which is directly in front.
18. **"forward"**: Move onto the now open door at [7,8].

By approaching the door from the position [8,8] and facing west, the agent is adjacent to the door and directly facing it, satisfying the conditions needed to toggle (open) the door successfully. Additionally, the agent has the red key in the inventory, which is required to unlock the locked red door.

This corrected sequence ensures that the agent successfully opens the door, achieving the goal of the level.
