```Python
["forward", "pickup", "forward", "left", "forward", "left", "toggle"]
```

Explanation:

1. **"forward"**: The agent moves forward from position `[7, 1]` to `[6, 1]` while facing left (`[-1, 0]`).
2. **"pickup"**: At `[6, 1]` facing left, the agent picks up the `green_ball` located at `[5, 1]`. This removes the `green_ball` from `[5, 1]` and adds it to the agent's inventory. This step clears the path blocked by the `green_ball`.
3. **"forward"**: The agent moves forward to `[5, 1]`, occupying the space previously held by the `green_ball`.
4. **"left"**: The agent turns left from facing left (`[-1, 0]`) to facing upward (`[0, 1]`).
5. **"forward"**: Moving forward, the agent advances to `[5, 2]` while facing upward.
6. **"left"**: The agent turns left again, changing direction from upward (`[0, 1]`) to facing left (`[-1, 0]`).
7. **"toggle"**: While at `[5, 2]` facing left, the agent toggles the `closed_blue_door` at `[4, 2]` to open it. This action converts the `closed_blue_door` into an `open_blue_door`, allowing passage through it.

By following these steps, the agent successfully opens one of the blue doors as required by the level's goal. The initial attempt failed because the agent tried to toggle the door from a position where it wasn't adjacent to the door, so the `toggle` action had no effect. This corrected sequence ensures the agent is properly positioned and oriented to interact with the door.
