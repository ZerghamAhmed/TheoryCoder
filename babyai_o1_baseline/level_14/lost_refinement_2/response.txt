**Explanation:**

1. **right**: Turn to face upwards (agent_direction becomes [0, 1]).
2. **forward**: Move from [7,1] to [7,2].
3. **forward**: Move from [7,2] to [7,3]. Cannot proceed further up due to a wall at [7,4].
4. **left**: Turn to face left (agent_direction becomes [-1, 0]).
5. **forward**: Move from [7,3] to [6,3].
6. **right**: Turn to face upwards (agent_direction becomes [0, 1]).
7. **forward**: Move to the closed_purple_door at [6,4].
8. **toggle**: Open the closed_purple_door at [6,4].
9. **forward**: Move from [6,4] to [6,5].
10. **forward**: Move from [6,5] to [6,6].
11. **forward**: Move from [6,6] to [6,7].
12. **left**: Turn to face left (agent_direction becomes [-1, 0]).
13. **forward**: Move from [6,7] to [5,7].
14. **forward**: Move from [5,7] to [4,7], where the closed_blue_door is located.
15. **toggle**: Open the closed_blue_door at [4,7].
16. **right**: Turn to face downwards (agent_direction becomes [0, -1]).
17. **right**: Turn to face right (agent_direction becomes [1, 0]).
18. **forward**: Move from [4,7] to [5,7].
19. **forward**: Move from [5,7] to [6,7].
20. **right**: Turn to face downwards (agent_direction becomes [0, -1]).
21. **forward**: Move from [6,7] to [6,6].
22. **forward**: Move from [6,6] to [6,5].
23. **forward**: Move from [6,5] to [6,4].
24. **forward**: Move from [6,4] to [6,3].
25. **forward**: Move from [6,3] to [6,2].
26. **left**: Turn to face left (agent_direction becomes [-1, 0]).
27. **forward**: Move from [6,2] to [5,2].
28. **forward**: Move from [5,2] to [4,2], where the second closed_blue_door is located.
29. **toggle**: Open the closed_blue_door at [4,2].

By following these actions, the agent successfully opens both blue doors as required to win the level. The first blue door at [4,7] is opened after navigating through the purple door and moving northward. The agent then retraces steps and proceeds to the second blue door at [4,2], opening it to complete the goal.
