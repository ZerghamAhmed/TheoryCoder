```Python
["left", "forward", "forward", "forward", "right", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "left", "toggle", "forward", "forward", "right", "pickup"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **left**: From the starting position at [10,6], the agent is facing south. Turning left will make the agent face east towards the green ball's direction.
   
2. **forward x3**: Moving forward three times while facing east moves the agent to [13,6], passing through [11,6] and [12,6]. This brings the agent close to the path leading south toward the green door.

3. **right**: Turning right from facing east makes the agent face south.

4. **forward x4**: Moving forward four times while facing south moves the agent through [13,5], [13,4], [13,3], and arrives at [13,2], which is adjacent to the closed green door at [14,2].

5. **left**: Turning left from facing south changes the agent's direction to face east, directly toward the closed green door.

6. **toggle**: Toggles (opens) the closed green door at [14,2], changing it to an open door.

7. **forward x2**: Moving forward twice while facing east moves the agent through the now open green door at [14,2] and onto [15,2].

8. **right**: Turning right from facing east changes the agent's direction to face south, towards the green ball at [15,3].

9. **pickup**: While at [15,2] and facing south, the agent is adjacent to and facing the green ball at [15,3]. The agent picks up the green ball, achieving the goal.

This sequence of actions allows the agent to navigate around walls and closed doors, open necessary doors, and reach the green ball efficiently without unnecessary steps or items. The plan avoids obstacles and utilizes the game's mechanics properlyâ€”toggling doors when adjacent and facing them and picking up items when adjacent and facing them. The agent doesn't need to collect any keys or interact with other objects because the doors on the path are not locked, only closed.
