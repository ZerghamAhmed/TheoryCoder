```Python
["left", "forward", "forward", "forward", "right", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "left", "toggle", "forward", "forward", "left", "pickup"]
```

Explanation:

In the previous attempt, the agent failed to pick up the green ball because it was not facing the ball correctly. The agent needs to be adjacent to the item and facing it to pick it up. In this corrected action sequence, we added an extra "left" action before the "pickup" action. This rotates the agent to face the green ball directly. Now, when the agent performs the "pickup" action, it will successfully pick up the green ball, thereby completing the level.
