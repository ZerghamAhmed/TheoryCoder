```Python
["left", "left", "forward", "pickup", "left", "left", "forward", "drop"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **left**: The agent turns left from facing down `[0, -1]` to facing right `[1, 0]`.
2. **left**: The agent turns left again from facing right `[1, 0]` to facing up `[0, 1]`.
3. **forward**: The agent moves forward from position `[5, 4]` to `[5, 5]` while facing up.
4. **pickup**: The agent picks up the yellow key which is located at `[5, 6]`, one square ahead in the direction it's facing.
5. **left**: The agent turns left from facing up `[0, 1]` to facing left `[-1, 0]`.
6. **left**: The agent turns left again from facing left `[-1, 0]` to facing down `[0, -1]`.
7. **forward**: The agent moves forward from position `[5, 5]` back to `[5, 4]` while facing down.
8. **drop**: The agent drops the yellow key in the square `[5, 3]`, which is directly in front while facing down.

By dropping the yellow key at position `[5, 3]`, it is now adjacent to the yellow box at `[6, 3]`. This satisfies the goal of placing the yellow key next to the yellow box.
