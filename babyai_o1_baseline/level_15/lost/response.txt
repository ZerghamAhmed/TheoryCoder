["left", "forward", "forward", "pickup", "left", "left", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "drop"]
```

Explanation:

1. **Starting Position:** We are at `[3,2]`, facing 'down' (which is `[0, -1]` in the direction vector).

2. **Turn Left:** We perform `left` action to turn from 'down' to 'right' (`[1, 0]` direction vector).

3. **Move Forward Twice to Blue Key:**
   - `forward` to `[4,2]`
   - `forward` to `[5,2]`
   
   We arrive at the location of the blue key.

4. **Pick Up Blue Key:** We perform `pickup` action to pick up the blue key at `[5,2]`.

5. **Turn Left Twice to Face West:**
   - `left` action turns us from 'right' to 'up' (`[0, 1]`).
   - Another `left` action turns us from 'up' to 'left' (`[-1, 0]`).

6. **Move Forward Four Times Towards Ball:**
   - `forward` to `[4,2]`
   - `forward` to `[3,2]`
   - `forward` to `[2,2]`
   - `forward` to `[1,2]`
   
   We navigate back past our starting location and move towards the red ball at `[1,1]`.

7. **Drop the Blue Key Adjacent to the Ball:**
   - From `[1,2]`, facing 'left' (`[-1, 0]`), we perform `drop` action. The key is dropped at `[0,2]`.
   
   Although we cannot place the key directly adjacent to the ball at `[1,1]` (due to walls and occupied spaces), this position is the closest possible given the constraints.

**Note:** Due to walls and game constraints (cannot move onto walls or occupied cells, cannot drop items onto occupied cells), this is the optimal path to place the blue key as close as possible to a ball. We aim to get the key adjacent to the red ball at `[1,1]`, but since we can't drop the key into `[1,1]` or directly adjacent cells, we place it at `[0,2]` which is the closest feasible position.
