```Python

['left', 'forward', 'pickup', 'left', 'forward', 'forward', 'left', 'forward', 'drop']

```

Explanation:

1. **'left'**: The agent turns left from facing down ([0, -1]) to facing right ([1, 0]).
2. **'forward'**: Moves forward from [3, 2] to [4, 2].
3. **'pickup'**: Picks up the blue key at [5, 2]. The agent is at [4, 2], facing right, adjacent to the key.
4. **'left'**: Turns left to face up ([0, 1]).
5. **'forward'**: Moves forward to [4, 3].
6. **'forward'**: Moves forward to [4, 4].
7. **'left'**: Turns left to face left ([-1, 0]).
8. **'forward'**: Moves forward to [3, 4]. This position is adjacent to the green ball at [3, 5].
9. **'drop'**: Drops the blue key at [3, 4], placing it next to the ball.

By executing these actions, the agent successfully places the blue key next to a ball (the green ball at [3, 5]), thereby achieving the goal and winning the level.
