```Python
["left", "forward", "forward", "left", "toggle"]
```

**Explanation:**

To achieve the goal of opening the door on the agent's left, we need to navigate the agent to the position adjacent to the door and ensure it is facing the door before toggling it.

**Step-by-Step Breakdown:**

1. **Initial State:**
   - **Position:** `[13, 11]`
   - **Facing Direction:** `[-1, 0]` (Left)
   - **Carrying:** Nothing

2. **Action:** `left`
   - **Result:**
     - The agent rotates 90 degrees to the left (counter-clockwise).
     - **New Facing Direction:** `[0, -1]` (Down)

3. **Action:** `forward`
   - **Result:**
     - The agent moves one step forward in the direction it's facing.
     - **New Position:** `[13, 10]`
     - **Facing Direction:** `[0, -1]` (Down)

4. **Action:** `forward`
   - **Result:**
     - The agent moves one more step forward.
     - **New Position:** `[13, 9]`
     - **Facing Direction:** `[0, -1]` (Down)
     - The agent is now adjacent to the closed red door at position `[14, 9]`.

5. **Action:** `left`
   - **Result:**
     - The agent rotates 90 degrees to the left.
     - **New Facing Direction:** `[1, 0]` (Right)
     - The agent is now facing the door.

6. **Action:** `toggle`
   - **Result:**
     - The agent toggles (opens) the door in front of it.
     - The closed red door at `[14, 9]` changes to an open red door.
     - **Goal Achieved:** The agent has opened the door on its left.

**Why This Correction Works:**

- In the previous attempt, the agent moved upwards and tried to toggle in a position where there was no door, resulting in no changes.
- By adjusting the actions to move the agent downward and facing it towards the red door, we ensure that the `toggle` action affects the correct door.
- This sequence respects all game rules, avoiding walls and correctly interacting with the door.
