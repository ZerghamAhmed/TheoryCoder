```Python
["right", "forward", "forward", "left", "toggle"]
```

**Explanation:**

To achieve the goal of opening a door on the agent's left, we'll navigate to the red door located at `[14, 9]` and position the agent so that the door is on its left side when toggling. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Initial Position and Orientation:**
   - The agent starts at position `[13, 11]` facing left (direction `[-1, 0]`).

2. **Step-by-Step Actions:**

   - **Action:** `"right"`
     - **Effect:** The agent turns right from facing left (`[-1, 0]`) to facing down (`[0, -1]`).
     - **Reasoning:** We need to move south towards the door, so turning to face down is necessary.

   - **Action:** `"forward"`
     - **Effect:** The agent moves forward to `[13, 10]` while facing down.
     - **Reasoning:** Progressing towards the door's row.

   - **Action:** `"forward"`
     - **Effect:** The agent moves forward to `[13, 9]` while still facing down.
     - **Reasoning:** Now the agent is directly west of the door at `[14, 9]`.

   - **Action:** `"left"`
     - **Effect:** The agent turns left from facing down (`[0, -1]`) to facing right (`[1, 0]`).
     - **Reasoning:** Turning to face right positions the agent so that the door is on its left side.

   - **Action:** `"toggle"`
     - **Effect:** The agent opens the door at `[14, 9]`.
     - **Reasoning:** While at `[13, 9]` and facing right, the closed red door is on the agent's left. Toggling now opens the door, fulfilling the goal.

3. **Conclusion:**
   - By following these actions, the agent successfully opens the red door on its left side, achieving the level's goal.
