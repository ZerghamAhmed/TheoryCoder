["right", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "right", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "pickup"]

```

**Explanation:**

Starting from the initial position at [8, 11] facing up ([0, 1]):

1. **Right**: Turn right to face east ([1, 0]).
2. **Forward x7**: Move forward seven times to reach [15, 11]. This moves the agent along the x-axis from x=8 to x=15.
   - After each forward action, the agent's position updates as follows:
     - Forward to [9, 11]
     - Forward to [10, 11]
     - Forward to [11, 11]
     - Forward to [12, 11]
     - Forward to [13, 11]
     - Forward to [14, 11]
     - Forward to [15, 11]
3. **Right**: Turn right to face south ([0, -1]).
4. **Forward x4**: Move forward four times to reach [15, 7]. This moves the agent along the y-axis from y=11 to y=7.
   - After each forward action, the agent's position updates as follows:
     - Forward to [15, 10]
     - Forward to [15, 9]
     - Forward to [15, 8]
     - Forward to [15, 7]
5. At [15, 7] facing south, the agent is adjacent to the blue ball at [15, 6] and is facing it.
6. **Pickup**: Pick up the blue ball. The agent now has the ball in their inventory.

This sequence ensures that the agent navigates around any walls, does not attempt to move onto the ball's square (which is not allowed), and follows all game rules for movement and item interaction. By ending adjacent to the ball and facing it, the agent successfully picks up the ball, achieving the goal of the level.
