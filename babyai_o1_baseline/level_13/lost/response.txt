```

**Explanation:**

1. **"right"**: The agent starts at position [15, 18] facing down ([0, -1]). Turning right changes the agent's facing direction to left ([-1, 0]). This prepares the agent to move towards the left (west) where the red key is located.

2. **"forward" x7**: Moving forward seven times in the left direction brings the agent from [15, 18] to [8, 18]. This positions the agent directly above the red key's location.

3. **"left"**: The agent turns left to face down ([0, -1]) towards the red key.

4. **"forward" x2**: Moving forward two times brings the agent to [8, 16], which is one square above the red key at [8, 15].

5. **"pickup"**: The agent picks up the red key since it is facing down towards it and is adjacent to its position.

6. **"forward" x2**: The agent moves forward to reach [8, 14], getting closer to the locked red door.

7. **"left"**: Turning left changes the agent's facing direction to right ([1, 0]), aligning it to move towards the door along the x-axis.

8. **"forward" x6**: Moving forward six times brings the agent from [8, 14] to [14, 14].

9. **"left"**: The agent turns left to face up ([0, 1]).

10. **"toggle"**: Standing adjacent to the locked red door at [14, 14] and facing it, the agent uses the red key to toggle (open) the door.

This sequence allows the agent to navigate from its starting position to the red key, pick it up, and then proceed to the locked red door to open it, achieving the goal of the level.
