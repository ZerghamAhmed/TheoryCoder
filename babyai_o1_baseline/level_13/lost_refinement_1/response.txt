```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence failed because after picking up the red key at position [8,15], the agent moved east towards [14,14] instead of west towards the locked red door at [3,14]. This led the agent away from the goal, and toggling at [14,14] did not open the red door.

In the corrected action sequence:

1. **Navigate to the Red Key:**
   - **Action 1:** `right` — Rotate the agent 90 degrees counter-clockwise from facing south ([0,-1]) to facing west ([-1,0]).
   - **Actions 2-8:** `forward` x7 — Move west from [15,18] to [8,18].
   - **Action 9:** `left` — Rotate the agent 90 degrees clockwise to face south ([0,-1]).
   - **Actions 10-11:** `forward` x2 — Move south to [8,16].
   - **Action 12:** `pickup` — Pick up the red key at [8,15] (one square ahead).

2. **Navigate to the Locked Red Door:**
   - **Action 13:** `right` — Rotate 90 degrees counter-clockwise to face west ([-1,0]).
   - **Actions 14-18:** `forward` x5 — Move west to [3,16].
   - **Action 19:** `left` — Rotate 90 degrees clockwise to face south ([0,-1]).
   - **Actions 20-22:** `forward` x3 — Move south to [3,13], adjacent to the door at [3,14].

3. **Face the Door and Open It:**
   - **Actions 23-24:** `left`, `left` — Rotate 180 degrees to face north ([0,1]), directly facing the door.
   - **Action 25:** `toggle` — Open the locked red door at [3,14].

By following this sequence, the agent successfully reaches the locked red door with the red key in its inventory, faces the door, and toggles it to open, thus completing the goal of the level.
