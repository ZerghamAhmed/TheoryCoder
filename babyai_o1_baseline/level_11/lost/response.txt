```Python
["left", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "left", "forward", "toggle", "pickup", "left", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "forward", "right", "forward", "right", "toggle"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **left**: From the starting position at [8,8] facing down ([0, -1]), we turn left to face right ([1, 0]) to move towards the red_box.
2. **forward x5**: We move forward five times to the right, moving from [8,8] to [13,8], bringing us closer to the red_box located at [13,10].
3. **left**: At [13,8], we turn left to face up ([0, 1]) to approach the red_box vertically.
4. **forward**: We move forward to [13,9], now standing directly below the red_box at [13,10].
5. **toggle**: Facing the red_box at [13,10], we toggle it. According to the game rules, toggling the box transforms it into a red_key since there's a locked_red_door and no existing red_key in the state.
6. **pickup**: We pick up the red_key now present at [13,10], adding it to our inventory.
7. **left**: We turn left to face left ([-1, 0]) to head back towards the locked_red_door.
8. **forward x5**: We move forward five times to the left, moving from [13,9] back to [8,9].
9. **right**: At [8,9], we turn right to face down ([0, -1]) to move towards the door's row.
10. **forward**: We move forward to [8,8], arriving adjacent to the locked_red_door at [7,8].
11. **right**: We turn right to face left ([-1, 0]), now directly facing the locked_red_door.
12. **toggle**: With the red_key in our inventory and facing the door, we toggle the locked_red_door, unlocking and opening it as per the game rules.

By following these actions, we successfully obtain the red_key needed to unlock the door and then open the locked_red_door, achieving the goal of opening the door in the level.
