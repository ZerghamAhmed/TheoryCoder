```Python

```

Explanation:

In the previous attempt, the agent tried to toggle the door while facing the wrong direction, so the door did not open. Specifically, after returning to position [8,8], the agent was facing east ([1,0]) instead of west ([-1,0]) towards the door at [7,8].

In this corrected action sequence, after obtaining the red key, we adjusted the final steps to ensure the agent is adjacent to the door and facing it before toggling:

- After moving back to position [8,9] and facing west ([-1,0]), the agent turns right to face south ([0,-1]).
- The agent moves forward to position [8,8].
- The agent then turns left to face west ([-1,0]), directly facing the door.
- Finally, the agent toggles the door, successfully opening it.

By making sure the agent is properly positioned and oriented towards the door before toggling, we achieve the goal of opening the door and winning the level.
