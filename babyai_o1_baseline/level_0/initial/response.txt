```Python

["left", "left", "forward", "pickup"]

```

**Explanation:**

We need to reach the yellow key located at position [5,6]. We start at position [5,4] facing down ([0, -1]). Here are the steps:

1. **Left Turn**: We turn left to face east ([1, 0]).
2. **Left Turn**: We turn left again to face up ([0, 1]).
3. **Forward**: We move forward to position [5,5].
4. **Pickup**: While at [5,5] and facing up, we are adjacent to the yellow key at [5,6]. We pick up the yellow key.

By following these actions, we successfully reach and pick up the yellow key, achieving the goal of the level.
