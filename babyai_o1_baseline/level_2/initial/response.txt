```Python
["left", "left", "forward", "pickup"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **left**: The agent turns left from facing South ([0, -1]) to face East ([1, 0]).
2. **left**: The agent turns left again to face North ([0, 1]).
3. **forward**: The agent moves forward one square to position [5, 5], facing North.
4. **pickup**: The agent is now adjacent to the yellow key at [5, 6] and facing it. Performing the pickup action allows the agent to pick up the yellow key.

By following this action sequence, the agent successfully picks up the yellow key, achieving the goal to win the level.
