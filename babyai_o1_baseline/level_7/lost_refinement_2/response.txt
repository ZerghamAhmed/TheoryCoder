Explanation:

This action sequence is designed to achieve the goal of placing the grey box next to the blue box and the grey key next to the green box, while adhering to the game rules.

**Steps to move the grey box next to the blue box:**

1. Starting at `[3,1]` facing down `[0,-1]`, the agent turns left twice to face up `[0,1]`.
2. Moves forward twice to reach `[3,3]`.
3. Turns left to face left `[-1,0]` and picks up the grey box at `[2,3]`.
4. Turns right twice to face right `[1,0]`.
5. Moves forward three times to reach `[6,3]` adjacent to the blue box at `[7,3]`.
6. Turns left twice to face up `[0,1]` via an intermediate left turn to face down `[0,-1]`.
7. Moves forward to `[6,2]`.
8. Turns left twice to face up `[0,1]`.
9. Drops the grey box into `[6,3]`, an empty square adjacent to the blue box.

**Steps to move the grey key next to the green box:**

10. Turns right twice to face down `[0,-1]`.
11. Moves forward to `[6,1]`.
12. Turns right to face left `[-1,0]`.
13. Picks up the grey key at `[5,1]` (adjacent and facing towards it).
14. Moves forward three times to reach `[3,1]`.
15. Turns left to face up `[0,1]` and moves forward to `[3,2]`.
16. Turns right twice to face down `[0,-1]`.
17. Drops the grey key into `[3,1]`, an empty square adjacent to the green box at `[2,2]`.

**Why this sequence is correct:**

- **Avoids dropping into occupied squares:** The agent ensures that when dropping items, the square in front is empty, complying with the game rule that you cannot drop an item if another item occupies that square.
- **Positions items correctly:** By dropping the grey box at `[6,3]` and the grey key at `[3,1]`, both items are placed adjacent to their respective targets (blue box and green box).
- **Correct handling of directions:** The agent carefully adjusts its facing direction before each action to ensure successful pickups, drops, and movements.
- **Avoids previous mistakes:** The sequence corrects the earlier failed attempts by careful planning to prevent dropping items into invalid positions and ensuring all actions result in state changes as intended by the game mechanics.

By following this action sequence, the agent successfully completes the level objectives within the constraints of the game.
