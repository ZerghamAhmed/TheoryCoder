Explanation:

This action sequence successfully completes the level by first placing the grey box next to the blue box, and then placing the grey key next to the green box.

**Steps 1-6 (Moving to and picking up the grey box):**
1. **left**: Turn left from facing down to facing right.
2. **left**: Turn left again to face up.
3. **forward**: Move from [3,1] to [3,2].
4. **forward**: Move from [3,2] to [3,3].
5. **left**: Turn left to face left towards the grey box.
6. **pickup**: Pick up the grey box at [2,3].

**Steps 7-12 (Moving the grey box next to the blue box):**
7. **right**: Turn right to face up.
8. **right**: Turn right again to face right.
9. **forward**: Move from [3,3] to [4,3].
10. **forward**: Move from [4,3] to [5,3].
11. **forward**: Move from [5,3] to [6,3], which is adjacent to the blue box at [7,3].
12. **drop**: Drop the grey box next to the blue box.

**Steps 13-18 (Moving to and picking up the grey key):**
13. **left**: Turn left to face up.
14. **left**: Turn left again to face left.
15. **forward**: Move from [6,3] to [5,3].
16. **right**: Turn right to face down.
17. **forward**: Move from [5,3] to [5,2].
18. **pickup**: Pick up the grey key at [5,1] (while standing at [5,2] and facing down).

**Steps 19-26 (Placing the grey key next to the green box):**
19. **right**: Turn right to face left.
20. **forward**: Move from [5,2] to [4,2].
21. **forward**: Move from [4,2] to [3,2], adjacent to the green box at [2,2].
22. **left**: Turn left to face down.
23. **forward**: Move from [3,2] to [3,1].
24. **right**: Turn right to face left.
25. **forward**: Move from [3,1] to [2,1], adjacent to the green box.
26. **drop**: Drop the grey key next to the green box.

This action sequence ensures that:
- The grey box is placed next to the blue box at [7,3], fulfilling the first part of the goal.
- The grey key is placed next to the green box at [2,2], fulfilling the second part of the goal.

By carefully navigating and manipulating the items according to the game rules, this sequence achieves the level's objectives without violating any constraints, such as not blocking doorways or walls.
