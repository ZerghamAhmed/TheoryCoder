```Python
["left", "left", "forward", "left", "forward", "pickup", "right", "forward", "right", "forward", "toggle", "forward", "forward", "drop", "right", "forward", "forward", "forward", "left", "forward", "pickup"]
```

Explanation:

1. **"left", "left"**: The agent turns from facing down ([0, -1]) to facing up ([0, 1]) by turning left twice.
2. **"forward"**: Moves forward to [4, 3].
3. **"left"**: Turns to face left ([-1, 0]).
4. **"forward"**: Moves forward to [3, 3], where the red_key is located.
5. **"pickup"**: Picks up the red_key. Now the agent is carrying the red_key.
6. **"right"**: Turns to face up ([0, 1]) to head towards the locked door.
7. **"forward"**: Moves forward to [3, 4].
8. **"right"**: Turns to face right ([1, 0]).
9. **"forward"**: Moves forward to [4, 4], adjacent to the locked_red_door at [5, 4].
10. **"toggle"**: Opens the locked_red_door using the red_key in the inventory.
11. **"forward", "forward"**: Moves through the now open door to [5, 4] and then to [6, 4].
12. **"drop"**: Drops the red_key at [7, 4] (since the agent is facing right, it drops the key at [7, 4]) to free up the inventory.
13. **"right"**: Turns to face down ([0, -1]) to move towards the box.
14. **"forward", "forward", "forward"**: Moves down to [7, 3], then to [7, 2], and then to [7, 1].
15. **"left"**: Turns to face right ([1, 0]), towards the box at [9, 1].
16. **"forward"**: Moves forward to [8, 1], adjacent to the box.
17. **"pickup"**: Picks up the red_box, achieving the goal.

**Why this is correct now:**

In previous attempts, the agent was unable to pick up the box because it was already carrying another item (like the red_key or red_ball), and the agent can only hold one item at a time. In this corrected sequence:

- The agent picks up the red_key to open the locked_red_door.
- After opening the door, the agent **drops the red_key** to free up inventory space.
- The agent then proceeds to the red_box and picks it up without any inventory constraints.

By ensuring the agent drops any carried items before attempting to pick up the box and avoiding blocking any doorways when dropping items, this action sequence successfully results in the agent picking up the box, thus winning the level.
