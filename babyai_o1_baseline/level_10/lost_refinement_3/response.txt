Explanation:

To successfully pick up the box, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Collect the Red Key**:
   - **Action**: `right`
     - From the initial direction facing down (`[0, -1]`), we turn right to face left (`[-1, 0]`).
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move from position `[4, 2]` to `[3, 2]`.
   - **Action**: `right`
     - Turn to face up (`[0, 1]`).
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move from `[3, 2]` to `[3, 3]`, where the red key is located.
   - **Action**: `pickup`
     - Pick up the red key at `[3, 3]`.

2. **Unlock the Locked Red Door**:
   - **Action**: `left`
     - Turn to face right (`[1, 0]`).
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move from `[3, 3]` to `[4, 3]`.
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move from `[4, 3]` to `[5, 3]`, adjacent to the locked red door at `[5, 4]`.
   - **Action**: `left`
     - Turn to face up (`[0, 1]`), facing the door.
   - **Action**: `toggle`
     - Use the red key to unlock and open the red door.

3. **Navigate to the Box Location**:
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move through the now open door to `[5, 4]`.
   - **Action**: `left`
     - Turn to face right (`[1, 0]`) to move east towards the box.
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move from `[5, 4]` to `[6, 4]`.
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move to `[7, 4]`.
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move to `[8, 4]`.
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move to `[9, 4]`.

4. **Pick Up the Box**:
   - **Action**: `right`
     - Turn to face down (`[0, -1]`) to move towards the box at `[9, 1]`.
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move from `[9, 4]` to `[9, 3]`.
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move to `[9, 2]`.
   - **Action**: `forward`
     - Move to `[9, 1]`.
   - **Action**: `pickup`
     - Pick up the red box at `[9, 1]`.

This action sequence ensures that we:
- Correctly navigate to and pick up the red key.
- Unlock the locked red door with the key.
- Safely navigate through the map without violating any game rules (e.g., not moving onto walls or dropping items incorrectly).
- Reach the box and pick it up, achieving the goal of the level.
