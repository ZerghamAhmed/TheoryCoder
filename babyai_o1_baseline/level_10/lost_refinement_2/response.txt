```

**Explanation:**

- **Step 1-2**: `left`, `left`  
  The agent starts by turning left twice to face upwards (from `[0, -1]` to `[0, 1]`).

- **Step 3**: `forward`  
  Moves forward to position `[4, 3]`.

- **Step 4**: `left`  
  Turns left to face leftwards (from `[0, 1]` to `[-1, 0]`).

- **Step 5**: `forward`  
  Moves forward to position `[3, 3]`, where the red key is located.

- **Step 6**: `pickup`  
  Picks up the red key.

- **Step 7**: `right`  
  Turns right to face upwards again (`[-1, 0]` to `[0, 1]`).

- **Step 8**: `forward`  
  Moves forward to position `[3, 4]`.

- **Step 9**: `right`  
  Turns right to face rightwards (`[0, 1]` to `[1, 0]`).

- **Step 10**: `forward`  
  Moves forward to position `[4, 4]`, adjacent to the locked red door.

- **Step 11**: `toggle`  
  Opens the locked red door using the red key.

- **Step 12-15**: `forward`, `forward`, `forward`, `forward`  
  Moves forward through positions `[5, 4]`, `[6, 4]`, `[7, 4]`, and `[8, 4]`.

- **Step 16**: `right`  
  Turns right to face downwards (`[1, 0]` to `[0, -1]`).

- **Step 17-19**: `forward`, `forward`, `forward`  
  Moves forward through positions `[8, 3]`, `[8, 2]`, and `[8, 1]`.

- **Step 20**: `pickup`  
  Picks up the red box at position `[9, 1]`.

By following this sequence, the agent successfully navigates to the red box, picks up the necessary key to unlock the door, opens it, and reaches the box without blocking any doorways or violating game rules. This accomplishes the goal of picking up the box and winning the level.
