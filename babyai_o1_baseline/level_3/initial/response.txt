```Python
["left", "left", "forward", "forward", "right", "toggle"]
```

Explanation:

1. **left**: The agent is initially facing south ([0, -1]) at position (3,1). Turning left changes the facing direction to east ([1, 0]).
2. **left**: Turning left again changes the facing direction to north ([0, 1]).
3. **forward**: Moving forward while facing north moves the agent to position (3,2).
4. **forward**: Moving forward again moves the agent to position (3,3), which is adjacent to the door.
5. **right**: Turning right changes the facing direction to east ([1, 0]), so the agent is now facing the door at (4,3).
6. **toggle**: Toggling while facing the door opens the closed red door at (4,3).

By following these actions, the agent moves to a position adjacent to the red door, faces it, and toggles it to open, thus achieving the goal of opening the red door.
