```Python
["left", "left", "down", "left", "up", "down", "down", "down", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

1. **left**: The avatar moves from `[6,5]` to `[5,5]`, pushing the box from `[5,5]` to `[4,5]`.
2. **left**: The avatar moves to `[4,5]`, pushing the box from `[4,5]` to `[3,5]`.
3. **down**: The avatar moves down to `[4,4]` to get behind the box for the next push.
4. **left**: The avatar moves to `[3,4]`, positioning behind the box at `[3,5]`.
5. **up**: The avatar pushes the box from `[3,5]` up into the hole at `[3,6]`, moving to `[3,5]`.
6. **down**: The avatar moves down to `[3,4]` to approach the second box.
7. **down**: The avatar moves to `[3,3]`, getting behind the second box at `[3,3]`.
8. **down**: The avatar pushes the second box from `[3,3]` down to `[3,2]`, moving to `[3,2]`.
9. **down**: The avatar pushes the box from `[3,2]` down into the hole at `[3,1]`.

By following this sequence, both boxes are successfully moved into their respective holes, meeting the game's win condition.
