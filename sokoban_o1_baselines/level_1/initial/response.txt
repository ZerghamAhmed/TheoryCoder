Explanation:

To win the level, the goal is to push all the boxes into the holes. Starting from the initial position of the avatar at (2,7), the following steps describe how the action sequence achieves this goal:

1. **Move Right to Reach the Box**:
   - **Actions**: `"right"` × 8
   - **Result**: The avatar moves from (2,7) to (10,7), positioning itself to navigate towards the box at (8,3).

2. **Move Down Towards the Box**:
   - **Actions**: `"down"` × 3
   - **Result**: The avatar moves down to (10,4), approaching the row of the box.

3. **Navigate to the Box**:
   - **Actions**: `"left"`, `"left"`
   - **Result**: The avatar moves to (8,4), directly above the box at (8,3).

4. **Push the Box Down**:
   - **Actions**: `"down"`
   - **Result**: The avatar moves into (8,3), pushing the box down to (8,2).

5. **Reposition to Push the Box Right**:
   - **Actions**: `"up"`, `"left"`, `"up"` × 3, `"left"`
   - **Result**: The avatar navigates around walls to reach (6,7), preparing to approach the box from the left.

6. **Move Down to Align with the Box**:
   - **Actions**: `"down"` × 5
   - **Result**: The avatar moves down to (6,2), aligning horizontally with the box now at (8,2).

7. **Push the Box into the Hole**:
   - **Actions**: `"right"`, `"right"`, `"right"`, `"right"`, `"right"`
   - **Result**: The avatar pushes the box from (8,2) to (9,2), then to (10,2), and finally into the hole at (11,2).

By following this sequence, the avatar successfully pushes one of the boxes into its corresponding hole. Repeating similar strategies for the remaining boxes will lead to winning the level.
