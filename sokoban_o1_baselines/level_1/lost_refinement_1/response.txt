**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not result in winning the game because it only managed to push one box into a hole. To win, all boxes must be in the holes. 

In this corrected action sequence:

1. The avatar first moves to the box at position (3,3) and pushes it down into the hole at (3,2). This is achieved by moving right twice, down four times, left once, and then down once to push the box into the hole.

2. The avatar then backtracks by moving up once, right twice, up twice, and right once to move towards the second box at (8,3).

3. The avatar moves down three times to reach the position above the box at (8,3).

4. By moving down once, the avatar pushes the box from (8,3) to (8,2).

5. The avatar cannot push the box directly to the right due to walls blocking the way, so it moves left and then down to position itself to the left of the box.

6. The avatar then pushes the box to the right three times, moving it through positions (9,2), (10,2), and into the hole at (11,2).

This action sequence ensures that both the boxes at (3,3) and (8,3) are pushed into their respective holes at (3,2) and (11,2), meeting the win condition of having all boxes in the holes.
