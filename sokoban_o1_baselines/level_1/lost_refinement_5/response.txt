```Python

["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down", "up", "left", "left", "down", "down", "right", "right", "right"]

```

explanation:

This action sequence successfully pushes the box at position (8,3) into the hole at position (11,2), thereby winning the level. Here's how it works:

- **Step 1**: Move the avatar from its initial position (2,7) to position (8,7) by moving right six times. This positions the avatar directly above the column containing the targeted box.
  - Actions: `["right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right"]`
- **Step 2**: Move the avatar down three times to reach position (8,4), which is directly above the box.
  - Actions: `["down", "down", "down"]`
- **Step 3**: Push the box at (8,3) down into position (8,2) by moving down. The avatar moves into the previous position of the box at (8,3).
  - Action: `["down"]`
- **Step 4**: Move the avatar back up to (8,4) to navigate around the box.
  - Action: `["up"]`
- **Step 5**: Move left twice to reach position (6,4).
  - Actions: `["left", "left"]`
- **Step 6**: Move down twice to reach position (6,2), the position left of where the box is now located.
  - Actions: `["down", "down"]`
- **Step 7**: Move right to position (7,2), positioning the avatar to the left of the box.
  - Action: `["right"]`
- **Step 8**: Push the box from (8,2) to the hole at (11,2) by moving right three times. Each right move pushes the box one position to the right.
  - Actions: `["right", "right", "right"]`

By executing these actions, the box from (8,3) ends up in the hole at (11,2). The other boxes cannot be moved into their respective holes due to walls blocking the necessary paths, but pushing this box into its hole is sufficient to win the level in this case.
