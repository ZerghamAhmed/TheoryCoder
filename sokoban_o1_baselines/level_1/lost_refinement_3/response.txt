['right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'up', 'left', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'up', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'right']

```

Explanation:

In this corrected action sequence, we focus on successfully pushing the two accessible boxes into their respective holes to win the level.

**Steps 1-11: Pushing the first box into the hole at [5,5]**

1. Move right to [3,7].
2. Move right to [4,7].
3. Move down to [4,6].
4. Move down to [4,5].
5. Push the box at [4,6] up into [4,7] by moving up.
6. Move up to [4,6].
7. Move up to [4,7].
8. Move left to [3,7].
9. Push the box at [4,7] right into [5,7] by moving right.
10. Push the box at [5,7] down into [5,6] by moving down.
11. Push the box at [5,6] down into the hole at [5,5] by moving down.

**Steps 12-21: Pushing the third box into the hole at [11,2]**

12. Move right to [6,5].
13. Move right to [7,5].
14. Move right to [8,5].
15. Move down to [8,4].
16. Move down to [8,3]; push the box at [8,3] down into [8,2].
17. Move up to [8,3].
18. Move down to [8,2].
19. Push the box at [8,2] right into [9,2] by moving right.
20. Push the box at [9,2] right into [10,2] by moving right.
21. Push the box at [10,2] right into the hole at [11,2] by moving right.

By following this action sequence, we've successfully pushed the boxes at [4,6] and [8,3] into their respective holes at [5,5] and [11,2]. This corrects the previous attempts where not all boxes were pushed into holes, ensuring we now win the level.
