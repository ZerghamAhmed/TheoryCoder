```Python
[
"down", "down", "down", "right", "down",
"up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right",

```

**Explanation:**

1. **Push the box at [3,3] into the hole at [3,2]:**
   - `down`, `down`, `down`: Move from [2,7] to [2,4].
   - `right`: Move to [3,4].
   - `down`: Push the box from [3,3] to [3,2].

2. **Push the box at [8,3] into the hole at [11,2]:**
   - `up`: Move back to [3,4].
   - `right`, `right`, `right`, `right`, `right`: Move to [8,4].
   - `down`, `down`, `down`: Move to [8,1].
   - `right`, `right`: Push the box from [8,2] through [9,2], [10,2], to [11,2].

3. **Push the box at [4,6] into the hole at [5,5]:**
   - `left`, `left`, `left`, `left`, `left`: Move back to [3,1].
   - `up`, `up`: Move to [3,3].
   - `right`: Move to [4,3].
   - `up`: Move to [4,4].
   - `right`: Move to [5,4].
   - `down`: Push the box from [5,6] to [5,5].

By following this action sequence, all three boxes are successfully pushed into their respective holes, resulting in winning the level.
