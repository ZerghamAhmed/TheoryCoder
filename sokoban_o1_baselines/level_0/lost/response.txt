explanation:

Starting from the initial state where the avatar is at position `[4,5]` and our goal is to push boxes into the holes at `[10,5]` and `[10,3]`, the action sequence above accomplishes this by moving two boxes into these holes.

**Step-by-Step Explanation:**

1. **"right"**: Move the avatar from `[4,5]` to `[5,5]`.
2. **"down"**: Push the box from `[5,4]` to `[5,3]`. The avatar moves to `[5,4]`.
3. **"down"**: Push the box from `[5,3]` to `[5,2]`. The avatar moves to `[5,3]`.
4. **"right" (5 times)**: Push the box along the bottom row from `[5,2]` to `[10,2]`, moving through `[6,2]`, `[7,2]`, `[8,2]`, `[9,2]`, and `[10,2]`. The avatar moves with the box.
5. **"up"**: Push the box up into the hole at `[10,3]`. The box moves from `[10,2]` to `[10,3]`, and the avatar moves to `[10,2]`.
6. **"down"**: Move the avatar back down to `[10,2]` to begin returning to the next box.
7. **"left" (5 times)**: Move the avatar back to `[5,2]` by stepping left through `[9,2]`, `[8,2]`, `[7,2]`, `[6,2]`, and `[5,2]`.
8. **"up" (2 times)**: Move the avatar up to `[5,4]` through `[5,3]`.
9. **"right"**: Move the avatar to `[6,4]`.
10. **"up"**: Push the box at `[6,5]` up to `[6,6]`. The avatar moves to `[6,5]`.
11. **"right" (4 times)**: Push the box from `[6,6]` to `[10,6]`, moving through `[7,6]`, `[8,6]`, and `[9,6]`. The avatar moves with the box.
12. **"down"**: Push the box down into the hole at `[10,5]`. The box moves from `[10,6]` to `[10,5]`, and the avatar moves to `[10,5]`.

By following these actions, we have successfully:

- Pushed the first box from `[5,4]` into the hole at `[10,3]`.
- Pushed the second box from `[6,5]` into the hole at `[10,5]`.

Since all the holes are now filled with boxes, we have met the win condition of the game.
