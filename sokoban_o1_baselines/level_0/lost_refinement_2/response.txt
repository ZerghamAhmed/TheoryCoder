Explanation:

First, we move the avatar towards the box at position [2,2]:

1. `'left'` - Move from [4,5] to [3,5].
2. `'down'`, `'down'`, `'down'` - Move down to [3,2].
3. `'left'` - Move to [2,2], where the box is located.

We then push this box to the right towards the hole at [10,3]:

4. `'right'` x8 - Push the box from [2,2] to [10,2].
5. `'up'` - Push the box into the hole at [10,3].

Next, we move the avatar to the starting position for pushing the second box:

6. `'left'` x7 - Move back to [3,3].
7. `'up'` x3 - Move up to [3,6], getting behind the box at [4,6].

We push the second box towards the hole at [10,5]:

8. `'right'` x6 - Push the box from [4,6] to [10,6].
9. `'down'` - Push the box into the hole at [10,5].

By pushing both boxes into the two holes, we've met the objective of the level which is to fill all the holes with boxes, thus winning the game.
