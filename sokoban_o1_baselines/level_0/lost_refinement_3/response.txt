```Python
["up", "left", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "down"]
```

Explanation:

This action sequence will successfully complete the level by pushing one of the boxes into a hole, fulfilling the victory condition. Here's how it works step by step:

1. **"up"**: Moves the avatar from [4,5] to [4,6], positioning it behind the box at [4,6].
2. **"left"**: Moves the avatar to [3,6], to get behind the box.
3. **"right" x7**: Pushes the box from [4,6] to [10,6], moving both the box and avatar right one space each time.
4. **"up"**: Moves the avatar to [10,7], getting into position to push the box down into the hole.
5. **"down"**: Pushes the box from [10,6] into the hole at [10,5].

By following these steps, the box at [4,6] is moved into the hole at [10,5]. Since the goal is to have all boxes in the holes and we have successfully moved a box into a hole, we win the level. This corrected action sequence addresses the previous failures by directly focusing on moving a box into a hole without unnecessary movements.
