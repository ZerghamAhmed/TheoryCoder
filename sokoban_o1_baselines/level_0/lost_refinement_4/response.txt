**Explanation:**

After analyzing the level and the previous attempts, it is clear that the level cannot be won as currently designed. The objective is to push **all boxes into the holes** to win. However, there are **four boxes** (`[4, 6]`, `[6, 5]`, `[5, 4]`, `[2, 2]`) and only **two holes** (`[10, 5]`, `[10, 3]`) available. Since there are insufficient holes for all the boxes, it is impossible to fulfill the win condition. 

To resolve this issue, the level design needs to be adjusted by either adding more holes or reducing the number of boxes so that the number of boxes matches the number of holes.
