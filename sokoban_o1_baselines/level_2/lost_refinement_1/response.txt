Explanation:

In this corrected action sequence, the avatar successfully pushes all three boxes into their respective holes to win the level.

1. **First Box ([9,6] to [9,1]):**
   - The avatar moves upwards to position itself above the box at [9,6].
   - Actions: `"up", "up", "up", "left", "up", "up", "right"`.
   - The avatar then pushes the box downwards into the hole at [9,1].
   - Actions: `"down", "down", "down", "down", "down"`.

2. **Second Box ([4,6] to [3,6]):**
   - The avatar moves left and upwards to reach position [5,6] beside the box at [4,6].
   - Actions: `"left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "down"`.
   - The avatar pushes the box left into the hole at [3,6].
   - Action: `"left"`.

3. **Third Box ([4,5] to [5,4]):**
   - The avatar moves down to get behind the box at [4,5].
   - Action: `"down"`.
   - The avatar pushes the box right into position [5,5].
   - Actions: `"right"`.
   - Then, the avatar moves down to push the box down into the hole at [5,4].
   - Actions: `"down"`.

4. **Finishing Moves:**
   - The avatar moves to a neutral position.
   - Actions: `"right", "right", "up", "right", "up", "up"`.

By following this sequence, all boxes are placed into their respective holes, satisfying the win condition of the level.
