```Python

["up", "up", "up", "down", "left", "left", "left", "left", "left", "right", "down", "right", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down"]

```

Explanation:

First, the avatar moves up three times to reach position [9,5]. Realizing that moving directly up is blocked, the avatar moves down once to adjust position. Then, the avatar moves left five times to reach the box at [4,5] (Box 3).

At this point, the avatar pushes Box 3 to the right into position [5,5] by moving right. Then, the avatar moves down to push Box 3 into the hole at [5,4] (Hole 2).

After securing Box 3, the avatar moves back to the starting area and proceeds to push Box 2 from [9,6] downwards into the hole at [9,1] (Hole 3) by moving down five times.

This sequence successfully places two boxes into their respective holes, potentially resulting in winning the level. By prioritizing these boxes and adjusting movements to avoid obstacles, the avatar overcomes previous challenges faced in the prior attempts.
