```Python
["up", "up", "up", "up", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down",
"up", "left", "up", "left", "left", "up", "up", "left", "up", "left"]
```

**Explanation:**

To solve the level, we need to push all three boxes into their respective holes. Here's how the action sequence works:

1. **Push the box at [9,6] into the hole at [9,1]:**

   - **Actions:** `"up", "up", "up", "up"`
     - Move the avatar from [9,2] to [9,6], positioning behind the box at [9,6].
   - **Actions:** `"down", "down", "down", "down", "down"`
     - Push the box down by moving down five times, moving the box from [9,6] to [9,1]. The box falls into the hole at [9,1] and is removed from the game.

2. **Push the box at [4,6] into the hole at [3,6]:**

   - **Actions:** `"up"`
     - Move the avatar back up to [9,2].
   - **Actions:** `"left", "up", "left", "left", "up", "up", "left", "up", "left"`
     - Navigate the avatar to the position [5,6] next to the box at [4,6]:
       - Move left to [8,2].
       - Move up to [8,3].
       - Move left twice to [6,3].
       - Move up twice to [6,5].
       - Move left to [5,5].
       - Move up to [5,6].
     - **Action:** `"left"`
       - Push the box from [4,6] into the hole at [3,6]. The box falls into the hole and is removed from the game.

3. **Attempt to push the box at [4,5] into the hole at [5,4]:**

   - Unfortunately, due to walls surrounding the box at [4,5], we cannot access it to push it into the hole at [5,4]. The walls at positions [4,4] and [4,7] block vertical movement, and the box itself blocks horizontal movement.

**Conclusion:**

Despite our best efforts, it's not possible to win the level because the walls prevent us from pushing the third box into its hole. The walls block all possible paths to maneuver the avatar behind the box at [4,5], making it impossible to push it into the hole at [5,4]. Therefore, under the given level configuration, the level cannot be completed.
