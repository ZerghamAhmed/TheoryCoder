```Python
["up", "up", "up", "left", "up", "up", "left", "left", "left", "up", "left", "down", "right", "down", "right", "right", "down", "down"]
```

Explanation:

This action sequence will result in winning the level by pushing all three boxes into their respective holes:

1. **Push the box at [9,6] into the hole at [9,1]:**
   - Move `up` three times to reach [9,5].
   - Move `up` again to push the box from [9,6] down to [9,5], and the avatar moves to [9,6].
   - Move `left` to [8,6].
   - Move `up` twice to go around and position above the box.
   - Move `right` to [9,8] (assuming no wall at [9,8]).
   - Move `down` five times, pushing the box down towards the hole at [9,1].

2. **Push the box at [4,6] into the hole at [3,6]:**
   - Move `left` three times to reach [6,3].
   - Move `left` to [5,3].
   - Move `left` to push the box from [4,6] to [3,6] (the hole).

3. **Push the box at [4,5] into the hole at [5,4]:**
   - Move `down` to [5,2].
   - Move `right` to [6,2].
   - Move `down` to [6,1].
   - Move `right` twice to reach [8,1].
   - Move `down` twice to push the box into the hole at [5,4].

By following these steps, all boxes will be moved into the holes, and the level will be completed successfully.
