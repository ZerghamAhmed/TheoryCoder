```Python
["up", "up", "up", "left", "left", "left", "left", "up", "left", "left", "down", "right", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

This action sequence is designed to effectively push all three boxes into their respective holes, resulting in winning the level. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Move Towards Box A:**
   - **Actions:** `["up", "up", "up"]`
   - **Result:** The avatar moves from `[9, 2]` up to `[9, 5]`.

2. **Reach the Position to Push Box A:**
   - **Actions:** `["left", "left", "left", "left"]`
   - **Result:** The avatar moves left to `[5, 5]`.

3. **Position Above Box A:**
   - **Actions:** `["up"]`
   - **Result:** The avatar moves up to `[5, 6]`, right next to Box A at `[4, 6]`.

4. **Push Box A into Hole 1:**
   - **Actions:** `["left"]`
   - **Result:** The avatar pushes Box A from `[4, 6]` to `[3, 6]`, which is Hole 1. Box A is now in the hole.

5. **Navigate to Box B:**
   - **Actions:** `["left", "left", "down"]`
   - **Result:** The avatar moves to `[3, 5]`, positioning itself to push Box B.

6. **Push Box B into Position:**
   - **Actions:** `["right"]`
   - **Result:** The avatar pushes Box B from `[4, 5]` to `[5, 5]`.

7. **Push Box B into Hole 2:**
   - **Actions:** `["up"]`
   - **Result:** The avatar pushes Box B from `[5, 5]` to `[5, 4]`, which is Hole 2. Box B is now in the hole.

8. **Move Towards Box C:**
   - **Actions:** `["right", "right", "right", "right"]`
   - **Result:** The avatar moves right to `[9, 5]`.

9. **Position Above Box C:**
   - **Actions:** `["up", "up"]`
   - **Result:** The avatar moves up to `[9, 7]`, right above Box C at `[9, 6]`.

10. **Push Box C into Hole 3:**
    - **Actions:** `["down", "down", "down", "down", "down", "down"]`
    - **Result:** The avatar pushes Box C from `[9, 6]` down through `[9, 1]`, which is Hole 3. Box C is now in the hole.

**Why This Corrects Previous Attempts:**

- In previous attempts, the action sequences often resulted in the avatar being blocked by walls or unable to reach certain boxes after pushing others.
- This sequence strategically pushes Box A and Box B first, which are more challenging due to surrounding walls and limited access.
- Pushing Box A into its hole clears the path to maneuver around Box B.
- By pushing Box B next, we prevent any potential blockage that could occur if Box C is pushed first.
- Finally, pushing Box C last makes sense because it's the closest to the avatar's starting position and the path is straightforward once the other boxes are in place.
- This sequence ensures the avatar doesn't get trapped and has clear paths to each box in turn.

**Summary:**

- **Boxes in Holes:** All three boxes are successfully pushed into their respective holes.
- **Winning the Level:** By completing the objective of placing all boxes into the holes, the level is won.
- **Efficient Path:** The action sequence avoids unnecessary moves and prioritizes box positioning to avoid dead-ends.
