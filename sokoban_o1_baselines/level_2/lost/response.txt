**Explanation:**

In this level, the goal is to push all three boxes into the corresponding holes. The avatar starts at position `[9, 2]`, and the boxes and holes are located as follows:

- **Boxes:**
  - Box 1 at `[9, 6]`
  - Box 2 at `[4, 6]`
  - Box 3 at `[4, 5]`

- **Holes:**
  - Hole 1 at `[9, 1]`
  - Hole 2 at `[3, 6]`
  - Hole 3 at `[5, 4]`

The action sequence is designed to push each box into its nearest hole efficiently while navigating around walls.

**Step-by-Step Actions:**

1. **Pushing Box 1 into Hole 1:**

   - **Navigate behind Box 1:**
     - Move `up` to `[9, 3]`
     - Move `up` to `[9, 4]`
     - Move `up` to `[9, 5]`
     - Move `left` to `[8, 5]` (avoid directly moving into the box)
     - Move `up` to `[8, 6]`
     - Move `up` to `[8, 7]`
     - Move `right` to `[9, 7]` (positioned behind Box 1)

   - **Push Box 1 down to Hole 1:**
     - Move `down` to `[9, 6]` (pushes Box 1 to `[9, 5]`)
     - Move `down` to `[9, 5]` (pushes Box 1 to `[9, 4]`)
     - Move `down` to `[9, 4]` (pushes Box 1 to `[9, 3]`)
     - Move `down` to `[9, 3]` (pushes Box 1 to `[9, 2]`)
     - Move `down` to `[9, 2]` (pushes Box 1 into Hole 1 at `[9, 1]`)

2. **Moving to Box 2:**

   - **Navigate to the right of Box 2:**
     - From `[9, 2]`, move `up` to `[9, 3]`
     - Move `up` to `[9, 4]`
     - Move `up` to `[9, 5]`
     - Move `left` to `[8, 5]`
     - Move `left` to `[7, 5]`
     - Move `left` to `[6, 5]`
     - Move `left` to `[5, 5]`
     - Move `up` to `[5, 6]` (positioned to the right of Box 2)

3. **Pushing Box 2 into Hole 2:**

   - **Push Box 2 left to Hole 2:**
     - Move `left` to `[4, 6]` (pushes Box 2 to `[3, 6]`, which is Hole 2)

4. **Preparing to Push Box 3 into Hole 3:**

   - **Position to push Box 3:**
     - Move `right` to `[5, 6]`
     - Move `down` to `[5, 5]` (now adjacent to Box 3 on the right)

5. **Pushing Box 3 into Hole 3:**

   - **Push Box 3 right to align with Hole 3:**
     - Move `left` to `[4, 5]` (pushes Box 3 to `[5, 5]`)

   - **Reposition to push Box 3 down:**
     - Move `up` to `[4, 6]`
     - Move `right` to `[5, 6]`

   - **Push Box 3 down into Hole 3:**
     - Move `down` to `[5, 5]` (pushes Box 3 into Hole 3 at `[5, 4]`)

**Summary:**

- The avatar first pushes Box 1 down into Hole 1 by navigating behind it and pushing it straight down.
- Then, the avatar moves to Box 2 and pushes it left into Hole 2.
- Finally, the avatar aligns Box 3 by pushing it right, repositions, and then pushes it down into Hole 3.

By following this action sequence, all boxes are placed into their respective holes without any obstruction from walls, thus winning the level.
