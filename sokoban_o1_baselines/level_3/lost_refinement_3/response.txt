```Python
["right", "down", "down", "left", "left", "left", "down", "left", "up", "right", "up", "left", "down", "right", "up", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

Starting from the initial position `(4,5)`, the goal is to push all boxes into the holes. Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. **Move Right**: `right` to `(5,5)` to position ourselves for approaching the boxes.
2. **Move Down Twice**: `down`, `down` to `(5,3)` to get behind the box at `(4,3)`.
3. **Push Box Left**: `left` to `(4,3)`, pushing the box to `(3,3)`.
4. **Push Box Further Left**: `left`, `left` to `(2,3)`, moving the box to `(1,3)`.
5. **Push Box Down into Hole**: `down` to `(1,2)`, pushing the box into the hole at `(1,2)`.
6. **Navigate Back Up**: `left`, `up`, `right`, `up` to reach `(3,4)`.
7. **Push Second Box Into Hole**: `left` to `(2,4)`, then `down` to `(2,2)`, pushing the box at `(2,2)` into the hole.
8. **Position for Third Box**: `right`, `up`, `right` to get behind the box at `(3,2)`.
9. **Push Third Box Into Hole**: From `(4,2)`, push the box up with `up`, moving it into the hole at `(3,5)`.

By following these actions, all three boxes are pushed into their respective holes, achieving the goal of the level.
