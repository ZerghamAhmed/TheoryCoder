```Python
["left", "down", "down", "left", "down", "right", "right", "up", "left", "up", "left", "down", "down", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

In this action sequence, we aim to push all three boxes into their respective holes by carefully navigating around the walls and utilizing the available paths.

1. **Move towards the first box:**

   - `left`: Move from `[4,5]` to `[3,5]`.
   - `down`: Move to `[3,4]`.
   - `down`: Move to `[3,3]`.

2. **Push the first box into the hole at `[3,5]`:**

   - `left`: Move to `[2,3]`.
   - `down`: Move to `[2,2]`.
   - `right`: Push the box from `[2,2]` to `[3,2]`.
   - `right`: Push the box from `[3,2]` to `[4,2]`.
   - `up`: Push the box from `[4,2]` to `[4,3]`.
   - `left`: Push the box from `[4,3]` to `[3,3]`.
   - `up`: Push the box from `[3,3]` to `[3,4]`.
   - `left`: Move to `[2,4]`.
   - `down`: Move to `[2,3]`.
   - `down`: Move to `[2,2]`.

3. **Push the second box into the hole at `[1,2]`:**

   - `right`: Move to `[3,2]`.
   - `up`: Move to `[3,3]`.
   - `right`: Move to `[4,3]`.
   - `up`: Move to `[4,4]`.
   - `left`: Push the box from `[4,4]` to `[3,4]`.
   - `up`: Push the box from `[3,4]` to `[3,5]` (hole).

4. **Push the third box into the hole at `[3,4]`:**

   - `down`: Move to `[3,4]`.
   - `down`: Move to `[3,3]`.
   - `right`: Move to `[4,3]`.
   - `up`: Push the box from `[4,3]` to `[4,4]`.
   - `right`: Move to `[5,4]`.
   - `up`: Push the box from `[5,4]` to `[5,5]`.
  
By following these actions, all three boxes are pushed into the holes, and the level is completed.
