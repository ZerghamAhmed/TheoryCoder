```Python

```

Explanation:

This action sequence ensures that all three boxes are pushed into their respective holes without blocking the avatar's path or causing any deadlocks.

1. **Move to the left side of the map:**
   - `"left", "left"`: The avatar moves from `[4,5]` to `[2,5]`, positioning itself near the first hole at `[3,5]`.

2. **Navigate down to the boxes:**
   - `"down", "down"`: The avatar moves down to `[2,3]`, approaching the first box at `[2,2]`.

3. **Push the first box into the hole at `[1,2]`:**
   - `"left", "down"`: The avatar moves to `[1,3]`, then down to `[1,2]`, pushing the box into the hole.

4. **Reposition to push the second box:**
   - `"left", "down"`: The avatar cannot move further left due to the wall, so it moves down to `[1,1]` to get behind the second box.
   - `"right", "up"`: The avatar moves right to `[2,1]` and up to `[2,2]`, pushing the second box upwards.

5. **Push the second box into the hole at `[3,4]`:**
   - `"right", "up"`: The avatar moves to `[3,2]` and then up to `[3,3]`, pushing the box towards the hole.
   - `"right", "down"`: The avatar moves right to `[4,3]` and down to `[4,2]` to position itself to push the box left.
   - `"left", "up"`: The avatar pushes the box into the hole at `[3,4]`.

6. **Push the third box into the hole at `[3,5]`:**
   - `"left", "up", "up"`: The avatar moves to `[2,3]`, then up twice to `[2,5]`, gets behind the third box, and pushes it down into the hole at `[3,5]`.

This corrected sequence avoids the mistakes in previous attempts by ensuring the avatar doesn't get trapped and pushes the boxes in an order that doesn't block access to other boxes or holes.
