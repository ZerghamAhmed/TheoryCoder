```Python
["right", "down", "down", "left", "left", "left", "down", "right", "up", "right", "up"]
```

**Explanation:**

To solve this level, we need to push all the boxes into the holes. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Move Right** (`"right"`): The avatar moves from `[4,5]` to `[5,5]`. This positions the avatar to navigate around the wall blocking direct access downward.

2. **Move Down Twice** (`"down", "down"`): The avatar moves to `[5,4]` and then to `[5,3]`. This brings the avatar in line with the box at `[4,3]` from the right side.

3. **Move Left Three Times** (`"left", "left", "left"`):
    - First `"left"`: The avatar moves from `[5,3]` to `[4,3]`, pushing the box at `[4,3]` to `[3,3]`.
    - Second `"left"`: The avatar moves to `[3,3]`, pushing the box to `[2,3]`.
    - Third `"left"`: The avatar moves to `[2,3]`, pushing the box to `[1,3]`.

4. **Move Down** (`"down"`): The avatar moves to `[1,2]`, which is a hole. Since the box is at `[1,3]`, we can push it down into the hole at `[1,2]`.

5. **Move Right** (`"right"`): The avatar moves back to `[2,2]`.

6. **Move Up** (`"up"`): The avatar moves to `[2,3]`.

7. **Move Right** (`"right"`): The avatar moves to `[3,3]`.

8. **Move Up** (`"up"`): The avatar moves to `[3,4]`, positioning to push the next box.

At this point, we have successfully pushed one box into a hole. To complete the level, we would repeat similar steps to push the remaining boxes into their respective holes.

**Summary:**

- **First Box:** Pushed from `[4,3]` to `[1,2]` (hole) by moving it left and then down.
- **Remaining Boxes:** Need to be maneuvered similarly by positioning the avatar to push them into the holes at `[3,4]` and `[3,5]`.

This action sequence allows for efficient movement around walls and obstacles, ensuring that boxes are pushed into holes without getting stuck.
