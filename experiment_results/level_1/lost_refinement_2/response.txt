To win the level based on the high-level plan and the previous actions undertaken, here's the revised list of actions:

```Python
["down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "right", "up", "up", "right", "right", "down", "down"]
```

Here's an explanation of the corrections made:

The previous action sequence predicted `['down', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up']`. This sequence did not win the game because it failed to take into consideration the necessary interactions with objects in the game world, particularly the need to form and utilize rules effectively.

The high-level plan indicates forming a rule with `flag_word_1`, `is_word_2`, and `win_word_1`, followed by moving to `baba_obj_1` and `flag_obj_1`. 

In the revised sequence:
1. The initial `down` movements position `baba_obj` to interact with the necessary words - these movements align with manipulating the `baba_word` and `empty` spaces properly.
2. The correct sequences of `right` movements navigate through the empty spaces to reach the desired strategic locations closer to the required words to form the rule.
3. Additional `down` movements later in the sequence correct the trajectory from `y` positions to ensure `baba_obj` can push or form interactions right before the flag state.

In summary, by adjusting the last movements and ensuring proper access to `baba_obj` and necessary words, the sequence more effectively adheres to the requirements stipulated by the high-level plan, ultimately facilitating the successful execution of winning actions in this level.
