You are an AI agent that must come up with a transition model of the game you are playing. 

A BFS low-level planner that will use your synthesized transition model to find the low-level actions that will allow you to win levels of the game.

You are also given state transition after executing an exploratory collision that will help as well.
You wanted to collide with an object to see how you would interact with it and what would the result of colliding with it be.
Your transition as the result of this collision is given, so you will need to adjust your transition model based on this. 

The levels you start out with will be simpler but you will be adding on more and more as time progresses. 
So try to make the transition model general and avoid hardcoding anything from the state dictionary keys.

CURRENT STATE:
