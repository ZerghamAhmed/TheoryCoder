explanation:

• The avatar starts at (1,6). Moving downward first and then navigating right avoids the poison2 at (4,6).  
• We head down around the wall at (1,4) by stepping right to (4,5) and then dropping to (4,4).  
• We detour around the poison1 at (4,3) by going to (3,4) and then down.  
• In row 2, we remove box2 at (5,2) by stepping onto it, clearing the path.  
• We continue right and drop down at (10,2) to remove another box2 at (10,1).  
• Finally, we move right along row 1. Stepping onto dynamite at (17,1) pushes it onto poison2 at (18,1), removing both.  
• With the poison2 cleared, we can proceed safely to the goal at (20,1).
