explanation:

After carefully analyzing the layout, walls, and the blocking objects (including the dynamite directly above the avatar and the box at (5,2) that cannot be pushed past the wall at (6,2)), there is no route for the avatar to reach the goal at (2,6). A wall occupies (2,5), so the direct vertical path is blocked, and all alternate paths around the level are either walled off or lead into lethal poison without any way to neutralize it (e.g., by pushing a box or dynamite onto it) in a way that would open a clear path. Consequently, there is no valid sequence of moves that can place the avatar on (2,6) without dying. Hence, the empty list signifies that no winning solution exists under the given rules.
