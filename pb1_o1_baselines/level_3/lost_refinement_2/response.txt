```Python
[]
```

explanation:

After analyzing all possible routes, there is no viable path for the avatar to reach (2,6). Row 5 is effectively walled everywhere except at columns 8 and 19, but each of those vertical “openings” is blocked again when trying to proceed into row 6 or beyond. Other potential workarounds involving pushing boxes or dynamite run into walls or lethal poisons without ever clearing a route to (2,6). Consequently, there is no sequence of valid moves that allows the avatar to arrive at (2,6).
