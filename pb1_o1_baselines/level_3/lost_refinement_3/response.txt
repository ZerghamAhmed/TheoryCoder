```Python
[]
```

explanation:

After analyzing all possible routes and interactions (pushing dynamite or boxes, attempting to bypass walls and poison), there is no valid sequence of moves that allows the avatar to reach (2,6). The walls at row y=5 block every path upwards, and neither pushing boxes nor dynamite can remove walls or open a route to the goal. Consequently, no non-empty sequence of actions will succeed, so the solution is an empty sequence.
