explanation:

After carefully analyzing the layout of walls, poison, and pushable objects, there is in fact no legal path for the avatar to reach (2,6). The row of walls at y=5 blocks direct vertical movement, and every potential detour is blocked by either additional walls or lethal poison that cannot be bypassed or pushed away in a manner that would open a route. Dynamite cannot remove walls, and there is no configuration of pushing box1 or dynamite that clears a corridor to (2,6). Consequently, there is no action sequence that leads to the goal.
