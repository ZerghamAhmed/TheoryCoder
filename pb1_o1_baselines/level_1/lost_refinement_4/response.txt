explanation:

The above sequence carefully navigates around the walls and steers clear of poison tiles by pushing boxes or taking detours as needed. In particular, early “right” moves push the first box to free space, then “down” and “left” maneuvers allow going around the wall, followed by further moves to push and remove poison. By continuing to thread through open corridors (and removing any dangerous poison via box pushes), the avatar eventually reaches (19,8). This corrects the previous attempts (which got stuck or ended with the avatar dying) and ensures that the avatar stays alive to reach the goal.
