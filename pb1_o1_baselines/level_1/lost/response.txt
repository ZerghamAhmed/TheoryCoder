```Python

```

explanation:

After examining all possible ways to navigate or push objects so as to bypass the walls and deadly poison spots, there is no legal sequence of moves that allows the avatar to reach the goal at [19,8] without dying or becoming blocked. The walls partition the level in such a way that you cannot simply walk to the goal on row y=8 (because of the wall at x=6,y=8 and the poison at x=11,y=8), and there is similarly no viable path around the bottom (rows y=7,6,â€¦). Although it is possible to push boxes or dynamite to remove certain poison tiles, the arrangement of walls, poison, and objects in lower rows ultimately prevents safely navigating around to reach x=19,y=8. Consequently, there is no solution (an empty plan).
