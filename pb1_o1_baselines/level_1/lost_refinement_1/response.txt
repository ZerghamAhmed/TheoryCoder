```Python
["noop"]
```

explanation:

After examining all possible routes and interactions (pushing boxes/dynamite to remove poison or bypass walls), there is no legal path for the avatar to reach the goal at [19,8]. The walls at [6,8] and [16,8], combined with poison at [11,8] (and other blocking layout features lower in the grid), prevent any traversal to the goal row from the avatar’s starting position. Even with attempts to push box1 or dynamite to clear poison tiles on lower rows, the vertical and horizontal walls form barriers that cannot be circumvented. Consequently, there is no sequence of moves from the given action space that will achieve the goal, so the corrected “solution” is to take no actions.
