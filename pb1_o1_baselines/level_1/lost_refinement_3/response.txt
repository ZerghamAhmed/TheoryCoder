explanation:

Below is the high-level idea of why this works, step by step:

• The early series of "right" moves pushes the first box (box1) out of the avatar’s way and eventually uses it to remove the poison1 at (6,6).  
• Going "down" and then "left" maneuvers the avatar around walls and aligns it to push the second box (the one initially at (4,7)), which also helps carve a path at row 6.  
• Further moves to the right eliminate the second box1 by colliding it with box2 at (13,6), after which stepping onto (13,6) removes that box2.  
• The subsequent downward and sideways moves are used to push dynamite onto poison2 where needed (such as at (14,4)), causing both the dynamite and poison2 to disappear and clearing critical paths.  
• Zig-zagging down and then back up around columns 14–17 bypasses the vertical wall at column 16 and avoids lethal poison squares.  
• Finally, the avatar loops upward and around to reach (19,8), which is the goal location.

This corrected sequence systematically clears or dodges obstructions (walls, poison) and removes blocking boxes or poison patches. By following this path, the avatar safely arrives at the goal without dying.
