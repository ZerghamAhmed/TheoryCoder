```Python
["noop"]
```

explanation:

After analyzing the layout of walls, poison, boxes, and other objects, there is no legal route for the avatar to reach the goal at [1,1] without stepping on poison (and thus dying) or being completely blocked by impassable objects. All potential paths are obstructed by walls or lethal poison that cannot be pushed away (poison1 and poison3 cannot be pushed, and poison2 is too far from a safely pushable dynamite or box). Consequently, there are no moves that will lead to a winning state, so performing “noop” (no operation) is the only remaining (though unhelpful) action.
