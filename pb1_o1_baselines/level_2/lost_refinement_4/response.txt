```Python

```

explanation:

After carefully examining all possible movements and pushes given the walls, boxes, and poisons, there is no route from the avatar’s starting position at (7,8) to the goal at (1,1). Every potential path is blocked by walls or immovable obstacles, and the domain’s pushing rules do not allow clearing a path downward or around. Consequently, there is no valid action sequence that leads the avatar to the goal without dying or becoming stuck, so an empty sequence (doing nothing) is the only “corrected” answer.
