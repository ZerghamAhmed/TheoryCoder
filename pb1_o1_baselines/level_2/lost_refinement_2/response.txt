explanation:

After careful analysis of the level layout and the rules given, there is unfortunately no valid sequence of moves that can navigate the avatar from its initial position at (7,8) to the goal at (1,1) without dying or becoming completely blocked. The top row (y=9) is all walls, the bottom row (y=0) is all walls, and the intermediate rows that might allow passage are heavily blocked by walls, poison, and immovable obstacles. Pushing available boxes or dynamite does not open a path all the way to (1,1) since critical tiles along every potential route either contain poison1 (which cannot be neutralized by dynamite and kills the avatar instantly if stepped upon) or are walled off in such a way that we cannot maneuver boxes/dynamite sufficiently to clear a path. Hence, there is no winning solution under the stated rules.
