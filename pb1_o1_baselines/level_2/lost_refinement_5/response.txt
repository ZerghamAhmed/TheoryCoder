```Python
[]
```

explanation:

After analyzing all possible routes and the blocking walls, poisons, and boxes, there is no valid path for the avatar to reach (1,1) given the current layout of obstacles and the rules for pushing or removing objects. No sequence of moves can bypass the continuous wall lines (particularly around y=5) or safely remove/move the poisons and boxes in such a way as to create an unobstructed corridor down to the goal. Therefore, no non-empty action sequence can accomplish the objective, and returning an empty plan reflects that the level is unwinnable in this configuration.
