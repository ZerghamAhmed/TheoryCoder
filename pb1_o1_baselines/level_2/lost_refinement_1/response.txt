```Python
["noop"]
```

explanation:

After carefully analyzing the layout of walls, poisons, dynamite, and boxes, there is no legal path or series of pushes that would allow the avatar to reach the goal at (1,1) without dying or being completely blocked. The walls on row 5 block any route across the middle of the map, and the corridors on the far left and far right also become blocked by poison or by boxes that cannot legally be pushed in a way that would open a clear path. Consequently, there is no sequence of moves from the initial position (7,8) that leads to a safe arrival at (1,1). Thus “noop” (doing nothing) is the only “correct” move sequence under these impossible conditions, reflecting that the puzzle cannot be solved from the given start state.
