```Python
["left", "left", "left", "down", "down", "left", "up", "up", "right", "right", "up", "right", "down"]
```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it attempted to break the "WALL IS STOP" rule by pushing the "IS" word, but in this level, the "IS" tile cannot be moved. As a result, walls remained impassable, preventing Baba from reaching the flag.

To win the level, we need to change the rules by forming "KEKE IS YOU" so that we can control Keke, who is on the other side of the wall and can reach the flag. Here's how the corrected action sequence achieves this:

1. **["left", "left", "left"]**: Move Baba left from position `[6, 4]` to `[3, 4]`, reaching the "KEKE" word.
2. **["down", "down"]**: Push the "KEKE" word down from `[3, 4]` to `[3, 2]`.
3. **["left"]**: Move Baba to `[2, 2]`, next to the "IS" word.
4. **["up", "up"]**: Push the "IS" word up from `[2, 2]` to `[2, 4]`, aligning it vertically with "KEKE".
5. **["right", "right"]**: Move Baba to `[4, 4]`, positioning to push the "YOU" word.
6. **["up"]**: Push the "YOU" word up from `[3, 2]` to `[3, 3]`.
7. **["right"]**: Move Baba to `[4, 3]`.
8. **["down"]**: Push the "YOU" word down from `[3, 3]` back to `[3, 2]`, forming the vertical rule "KEKE IS YOU".

After these actions, the rule "KEKE IS YOU" is formed vertically at positions `[(3, 2), (2, 3), (3, 4)]`. Now, you gain control of Keke, who is at position `[3, 7]`. As Keke, you can move up to reach the flag:

1. **Move Up**: From `[3, 7]` to `[3, 8]`.
2. **Move Right**: From `[3, 8]` to `[4, 8]`.
3. **Move Right**: From `[4, 8]` to `[5, 8]`.
4. **Move Up**: From `[5, 8]` to `[5, 9]`, reaching the flag and winning the game.

**Summary:**

- **Why the previous action sequence failed:** It attempted to break "WALL IS STOP" by pushing "IS," but "IS" cannot be moved, so walls remained impassable.
- **How the corrected sequence works:** By forming "KEKE IS YOU," we gain control of Keke, who can bypass the walls and reach the flag to win the game.
