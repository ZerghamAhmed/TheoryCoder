["right", "right", "left", "up", "up", "up", "left", "left"]

The previous action sequence did not result in winning the game because it attempted to manipulate the "Keke" word tile without successfully forming a new rule that would change the game's outcome. Specifically, moving the "Keke" word around did not complete the formation of "Keke Is You," so control remained only with "Baba". Since "Baba" cannot reach the "Flag" due to the wall blocking the path and "Wall Is Stop" being in effect, the game could not be won.

In the corrected action sequence, we focus on breaking the "Wall Is Stop" rule. By moving right twice and then left once, we push the "Is" word out of alignment in the vertical "Wall Is Stop" formation, effectively deactivating the rule that prevents us from moving through walls. This allows "Baba" to pass through the wall to reach the "Flag". Moving upwards three times takes "Baba" through the wall (now passable), and moving left twice positions "Baba" onto the "Flag", which, with the "Flag Is Win" rule in place, results in winning the game.
