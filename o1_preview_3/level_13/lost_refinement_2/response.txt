```Python

["left", "left", "left", "down", "left", "left", "up", "right", "right", "right"]

```

**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not win the game because **Baba** could not reach the flag due to a wall blocking the path. 

To correct this, we need to gain control over **Keke**, who is positioned below the wall and can reach the flag directly.

**Steps:**

1. **As Baba**, move left three times to reach the **KEKE** word:
   - `left` to (5, 4)
   - `left` to (4, 4)
   - `left` to (3, 4)

2. Push the **KEKE** word down to align it for creating a new rule:
   - `down` to push **KEKE** to (3, 3)

3. Move left twice to position the **KEKE** word under the **IS** word:
   - `left` to push **KEKE** to (2, 3)
   - `left` to push **KEKE** to (1, 3)

4. Push the **KEKE** word up to replace **BABA** in the **BABA IS YOU** rule:
   - `up` to push **KEKE** to (1, 2), pushing **BABA** out of the way. This forms **KEKE IS YOU**.

5. **Now controlling Keke**, move right three times to reach the flag:
   - `right` to (4, 7)
   - `right` to (5, 7)
   - `right` to (6, 7), where the flag is located.

By forming **KEKE IS YOU**, we gain control over Keke and can bypass the wall that was blocking Baba. Keke can reach the flag unimpeded, resulting in winning the game.
