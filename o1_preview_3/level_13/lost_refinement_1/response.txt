Explanation:

The previous action sequence failed to win the game because moving `baba_obj` onto the `you_word` at position `[3,2]` caused the `BABA IS YOU` rule to break. This resulted in `baba_obj` no longer being controllable, leading to the game being lost.

To correct this, the new action sequence avoids breaking the `BABA IS YOU` rule. Instead, it focuses on breaking the `WALL IS STOP` rule by pushing the `is_word` and `stop_word` downwards, allowing `baba_obj` to pass through the wall and reach the `flag_obj`, which is the win condition.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the corrected action sequence:

1. **right**: Move `baba_obj` from `[6,4]` to `[7,4]`.
2. **right**: Move `baba_obj` to `[8,4]`, pushing `is_word` and `stop_word` down. The `is_word` moves to `[8,3]`, and `stop_word` moves to `[8,2]`. This breaks the `WALL IS STOP` rule.
3. **left**: Move `baba_obj` back to `[7,4]`.
4. **up**: Move `baba_obj` to `[7,5]`.
5. **up**: Move `baba_obj` to `[7,6]`. Since the wall no longer stops movement, `baba_obj` can pass through.
6. **up**: Move `baba_obj` to `[7,7]`.
7. **left**: Move `baba_obj` to `[6,7]`, where the `flag_obj` is located. Since `FLAG IS WIN` is formed, touching the flag results in winning the game.

By executing these actions, we avoid breaking the essential rules that keep `baba_obj` controllable and manipulate the environment to reach the win condition.
