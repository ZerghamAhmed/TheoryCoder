To solve this level, we need to transform the rock into a flag and then reach it to win the game. Here's how we can do it:

1. **Break the "ROCK IS ROCK" rule**: This rule is preventing the rock from transforming into a flag because "ROCK IS FLAG" is being overridden. By moving the "IS" word out of the "ROCK IS ROCK" sentence, we disable this rule.
2. **Allow "ROCK IS FLAG" to take effect**: With "ROCK IS ROCK" broken, the "ROCK IS FLAG" rule becomes active, turning the rock into a flag.
3. **Reach the flag**: Now that the rock is a flag and "FLAG IS WIN," we can reach the flag to win the level.

Here's the sequence of actions:

```Python
["right", "down", "down", "up", "up", "right", "right", "right", "right"]
```

**Explanation:**

- **"right"**: Move from [2,5] to [3,5].
- **"down"**: Move to [3,4].
- **"down"**: Push the "IS" word from [3,3] to [3,2], breaking the "ROCK IS ROCK" rule.
- **"up"**, **"up"**: Return to [3,5].
- **"right", "right", "right", "right"**: Move through [4,5], [5,5], [6,5], reaching [7,5] where the rock has turned into a flag.
- **Win the level**: Touch the flag at [7,5] because "FLAG IS WIN."

By following these steps, we successfully manipulate the game rules to transform the rock into a flag and then reach it to win the game.
