```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "down", "down", "down", "down", "right", "down"]
```

Explanation:

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it lacked the final move to reach the flag object, which is the winning condition once "FLAG IS WIN" is established. In the sequence, after pushing the "FLAG" word upward to attempt to form the rule "FLAG IS WIN", the player character (Baba) did not move onto the flag object located at position [7, 4]. By adding an extra "down" action at the end, Baba moves onto the flag object, satisfying the win condition and completing the level.
