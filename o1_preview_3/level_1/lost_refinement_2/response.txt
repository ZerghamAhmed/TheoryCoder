```Python

['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'up', 'down', 'down', 'down', 'right']

```

Explanation:

The previous action sequence did not win the game because after pushing the `flag_word` upward to activate the rule `"flag is win"`, the `baba_obj` did not move to the `flag_obj`. Instead, it moved down and ended up at position `[7, 2]`, which is below the `flag_obj` at `[7, 4]`. As a result, `baba_obj` never came into contact with the `flag_obj` after it became a winning condition.

In the corrected action sequence, after pushing the `flag_word` upward to align it with `is_word` and `win_word` (forming the rule `"flag is win"`), the `baba_obj` moves directly to the `flag_obj`. This is done by moving down three times to return to the original horizontal line and then moving right to reach the `flag_obj` at `[7, 4]`. By doing this, `baba_obj` touches the `flag_obj` when `"flag is win"` is active, resulting in winning the game.
