To win the level, our goal is to reach the `flag_obj` at position `[7, 7]` while maintaining the rule `FLAG IS WIN`. However, there are `goop_obj` tiles acting as sinks due to the rule `GOOP IS SINK`, which destroys any object (including us) that steps onto them. To safely reach the flag, we need to disable this sink property of the goop.

**Step-by-step reasoning:**

1. **Break the `GOOP IS SINK` rule:**
   - The rule `GOOP IS SINK` is formed vertically by the words at positions:
     - `goop_word` at `[1, 3]`
     - `is_word` at `[1, 2]`
     - `sink_word` at `[1, 1]`
   - By pushing the `is_word` at `[1, 2]` to the right, we disrupt the alignment, effectively breaking the rule. This will remove the sink property from all `goop_obj` tiles.

2. **Executing the plan:**
   - **Move down four times** to reach position `[2, 2]` below the `is_word`:
     - From `[2, 6]` to `[2, 5]`, `[2, 4]`, `[2, 3]`, and then `[2, 2]`.
   - **Push the `is_word` to the right**:
     - Face left and move left to push the `is_word` from `[1, 2]` to `[2, 2]`.
   - Now, `GOOP IS SINK` is broken.
   - **Move back up to our original row**:
     - Move up four times to return to `[2, 6]`.
  
3. **Navigate to the `flag_obj`:**
   - **Move right through the goop tiles** (which are now harmless):
     - Right to `[3, 6]`, `[4, 6]`, `[5, 6]`, and `[6, 6]`.
   - **Approach the flag**:
     - Move up to `[6, 7]`.
     - Move right to `[7, 7]`, where the `flag_obj` is located.

4. **Win the game:**
   - Since the rule `FLAG IS WIN` is still active, stepping on the `flag_obj` at `[7, 7]` will win the level.

By following these steps, we avoid the dangers posed by the goop and successfully reach the flag to win.
