```Python

['right', 'right', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'up', 'right', 'right', 'up', 'down', 'down', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'left', 'up']

```

Explanation:

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it failed to modify the game rules to make winning possible. Specifically, the player did not manipulate the 'win' word tile to create a new rule that would allow for victory.

In the corrected action sequence, we navigate Baba to the 'win' word tile located at position [8,8]. We push the 'win' word tile down and then move it left towards the 'baba is you' statement to replace the 'you' word with 'win', forming 'baba is win'. This changes the game rule so that Baba becomes win, resulting in an immediate victory when the rule is updated.
