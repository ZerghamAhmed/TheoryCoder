To solve this level, we need to create the phrase "Baba Is Win" while keeping "Baba Is You" intact. By doing so, Baba will be both controllable and a win condition, allowing us to win the level immediately.

**Explanation:**

1. **Move Right 4 times**: This gets Baba from position (2,5) to (6,5), approaching the area where the words "Flag Is Win" are located.
2. **Move Up 3 times**: This brings Baba to position (6,8), right below the "Flag" word at (6,8).
3. **Push "Flag" Down**: Moving down pushes the "Flag" word from (6,8) to (6,7), clearing the path at (6,8).
4. **Move Right**: Baba moves to (7,8), positioning below the "Is" word at (7,8).
5. **Push "Is" Down**: Moving down pushes the "Is" word from (7,8) to (7,7), further clearing the path.
6. **Move Right**: Baba moves to (8,8), where the "Win" word is located.
7. **Push "Win" Left 4 times**: By moving left four times, Baba pushes the "Win" word from (8,8) to (4,8), aligning it next to "Baba Is You" and forming "Baba Is Win".

With both "Baba Is You" and "Baba Is Win" active, Baba is both controllable and the win condition. The game recognizes this state, and you win the level.

**Action Sequence:**

```Python
["right", "right", "right", "right", "up", "up", "up", "down", "right", "down", "right", "left", "left", "left", "left"]
