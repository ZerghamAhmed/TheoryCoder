**Explanation:**

The previous action sequence did not win the game because it didn't alter the game rules to create a win condition that could be achieved. While the initial actions moved the controllable character (`baba_obj`) around the map, they didn't affect the rules or interact with any winning condition.

In the corrected action sequence, the key steps are:

1. **Modifying the Rule to 'ROCK IS WIN':**
   - **Pushing 'ROCK' Word Up:** We maneuver `baba_obj` to push the `'rock_word'` from its initial position up to replace the `'flag_word'` in the existing rule `'FLAG IS WIN'`, effectively changing it to `'ROCK IS WIN'`.
   - **Adjusting 'FLAG' Word Position:** We move the `'flag_word'` out of the way to allow `'rock_word'` to take its place.

2. **Winning the Game:**
   - **Touching the Rock Object:** With the rule now set to `'ROCK IS WIN'`, we move `baba_obj` to the position of the `'rock_obj'`. Touching it under the new rule causes the game to be won.

By altering the game rules and then interacting with the appropriate object, we satisfy the win condition.
